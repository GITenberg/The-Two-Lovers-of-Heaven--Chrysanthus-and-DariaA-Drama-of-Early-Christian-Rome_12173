<h2><i>Calderon's Family Motto.</i></h2>
<h3><b>"Por la Fe Morir&#233;".&#160; &#160; &#8212;&#160; &#160; <br />
For the Faith welcome Death.</b></h3>
</center>
<hr width="10%" />
<p>This motto is taken from the engraved coat of arms prefixed to an historical
account of "the very noble and ancient house of Calderon de la
Barca"&#8212;a rather scarce work which I have never seen alluded to in any
account of the poet.&#160; The circumstances from which the motto was
assigned to the family are given with some minuteness at pp. 56 and 57
of the work referred to.&#160; It is enough to mention that the martyr who
first used the expression was Don Sancho Ortiz Calderon de la Barca,
a Commander of the Order of Santiago.&#160; He was in the service of the
renowned king, Don Alfonso the Wise, towards the close of the thirteenth
century, and having been taken prisoner by the Moors before Gibraltar,
he was offered his life on the usual conditions of apostasy.&#160; But he
 refused
all overtures, saying: <i>"Pues mi Dios por mi muri&#242;, yo quiero morir
por &#232;l",</i> a phrase which has a singular resemblance to the key note of
 this
drama.&#160; Don Ortiz Calderon was eventually put to death with great
cruelty, after some alternations of good and bad treatment.&#160; See

<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>
<hr width="10%" />
<h3>THE PROFESSOR OF POETRY AT OXFORD AND THE AUTOS SACRAMENTALES OF
 CALDERON.</h3>
</center>
<hr width="10%" />
<p>Although the Drama here presented to the public is not an <i>Auto,</i> the
 present
may be a not inappropriate occasion to draw the attention of all candid readers
to the remarks of the Professor of Poetry at Oxford on the <i>Autos
 Sacramentales</i>
of Calderon&#8212;remarks founded entirely on the volume of translations from
 these
<i>Autos</i> published by me in
1867,<a name="aster" id="aster"></a><a href="#aster-note">*</a>
although not mentioned by name, as I conceive
in fairness it ought to have been, by Sir F. H. Doyle in his printed
Lectures.<a name="dagger" id="dagger"></a><a href="#dagger-note">&#8224;</a></p>
<p>In his otherwise excellent analysis of <i>The Dream of Gerontius,</i> Sir F.
 H. Doyle
is mistaken as to any direct impression having been made upon the mind of Dr.
Newman in reference to it by the <i>Autos</i> of Calderon.&#160; So late as
 March 3, 1867,
in thanking me for the volume made use of by Sir F. H. Doyle, Dr. Newman
implies that up to that period he had not devoted any particular attention even
to this most important and unique development of Spanish religious poetry.&#160;
The only complete <i>Auto</i> of Calderon that had previously appeared in
 English&#8212;my
own translation of <i>The Sorceries of Sin,</i> had, indeed, been in his hands
 from
1859, and I wish I could flatter myself that it had in any way led to the
production of a master-piece like <i>The Dream of Gerontius.</i>&#160; But I
 cannot
indulge that delusion.&#160; Dr. Newman had internally and externally too many
sources of inspiration to necessitate an adoption even of such high models as
the Spanish <i>Autos.</i>&#160; Besides, <i>The Dream of Gerontius</i> is no
 more an <i>Auto</i> than
<i>Paradise Lost,</i> or the <i>Divina Comm&#233;dia.</i>&#160; In these, only
 real personages, spiritual
and material, are represented, or monsters that typified human passions, but
did not personify them.&#160; In the <i>Autos</i> it is precisely the
 reverse.&#160; Rarely do
actual beings take part in the drama, and then only as personifications of the
predominant vices or passions of the individuals whose names they bear.&#160;
 Thus
in my own volume, Belshazzar is not treated so much as an historical
character, but rather as the personification of the pride and haughtiness of a
voluptuous king.&#160; In <i>The Divine Philothea,</i> in the same volume, there
 are no
actual beings whatever, except <i>The Prince of Light</i> and <i>The Prince of
 Darkness</i>
or <i>The Demon.</i>&#160; In truth, there is nothing analogous to a Spanish
 <i>Auto</i>
in English original poetry.&#160; The nearest approach to it, and the only one,
 is <i>The
Prometheus Unbound</i> of Shelley.&#160; There, indeed, <i>The Earth, Ocean, The
 Spirits
of the Hours, The Phantasm of Jupiter, Demogorgon,</i> and <i>Prometheus</i>
 himself,
read like the <i>Personas</i> of a Spanish <i>Auto,</i> and the poetry is worthy
 the
resemblance.&#160; The <i>Autos Sacramentales</i> differ also, not only in
 degree but in
kind from every form of Mystery or Morality produced either in England or
on the Continent.&#160; But to return to the lecture by Sir F. H. Doyle.&#160;
 Even in
smaller matters he is not accurate.&#160; Thus he has transcribed incorrectly
from my Introduction the name of the distinguished commentator on the
<i>Autos</i> of Calderon and their translator into German&#8212;Dr.
 Lorinser.&#160; This
Sir F. H. Doyle has printed throughout his lecture 'Lorinzer'.&#160; From
 private
letters which I have had the honour of receiving from this learned writer,
 there
can be no doubt that the form as originally given by me is the right one.&#160;
With these corrections the lecture of Sir F. H. Doyle may be quoted as a
valuable testimony to the extraordinary poetic beauty of these <i>Autos</i>
 even in
a translation.</p>
<blockquote>
<center>
<b>Lecture III.</b>&#8212;<i>Dr. Newman's Dream of Gerontius.</i>
</center>
<p>"It is probable, indeed, that the first idea of composing such a dramatic
work may have been suggested to Dr. Newman by the <i>Autos Sacramentales</i>
of Spain, and especially by those of the illustrious Calderon; but, so far as I
can learn, he has derived hardly anything from them beyond the vaguest
hints, except, indeed, the all-important knowledge, that a profound religious
feeling can represent itself, and that effectively, in the outward form of
a play.&#160; I may remark that these Spanish <i>Autos</i> of Calderon
 constitute
beyond all question a very wonderful and a very original school of poetry, and I
am not without hope that, when I know my business a little better, we may
examine them impartially together.&#160; Nay, even as it is, Calderon stands so
indisputably at the head of all Catholic religious dramatists, among whom Dr.
Newman has recently enrolled himself, that perhaps it may not be out of place to
inquire for a moment into his poetical methods and aims, in order that we
may then discover, if we can, how and why the disciple differs from his
 master.&#160;
Now there is a great conflict of opinion as to the precise degree of
merit which these particular Spanish dramas possess.&#160; Speaking as an
 ignorant
man, I should say, whilst those who disparage them seem rather hasty
in their judgments, and not so well informed as could be wished, still the
kind of praise which they receive from their most enthusiastic admirers
puzzles and does not instruct us.</p>
<p>"Taking for example, the great German authority on this point, Dr.
Lorinzer [Lorinser], as our guide, we see his poet looming dimly through a
cloud of incense, which may embalm his memory, but certainly does not
improve our eyesight.&#160; Indeed, according to him, any appreciation of
 Calderon
is not to be dreamt of by a Protestant".&#160; <i>Lectures,</i> pp. 109,
 110.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With every respect for Sir F. H. Doyle, Dr. Lorinser says no such
 thing.&#160;
He was too well informed of what had been done in Germany on the same
subject, before he himself undertook the formidable task of attempting a
complete translation of all the <i>Autos</i> of Calderon, to have fallen into
 such an
error.&#160; Cardinal Diepenbrock, Archbishop of Breslau, who, in his <i>Das
 Leben
ein Traum</i> (an <i>Auto</i> quite distinct from the well known drama <i>La
 Vida es
Sue&#241;o</i>) first commenced this interesting labour in Germany, was of
 course a
Catholic.&#160; But Eichendorff and Braunfels, who both preceded Dr. Lorinser,
were Protestants.&#160; Augustus Schlegel and Baron von Schack, who have
written so profoundly and so truly on the <i>Autos,</i> are expressly referred
 to by Dr.
Lorinser, and it is superfluous to say that they too were Protestants.&#160; Sir F.
H. Doyle, in using my translation of the passage which will presently be
quoted, changes the word 'thoroughly' into 'properly', as if it were a more
correct rendering of the original.&#160; Unfortunately, however, there is
 nothing
to represent either word in the German.&#160; Dr. Lorinser says, that by
 <i>many,</i> not by
all, Calderon cannot be enjoyed as much as he deserves, because a great
number of persons best competent to judge of his merits are deficient in the
knowledge of Catholic faith and Catholic theology which for the understanding
of Calderon is indispensible&#8212;<i>"welche f&#252;r Calderons
 Verst&#228;ndniss
unerl&#228;sslich ist".</i>&#160; Sir F. H. Doyle says that to him these
 <i>Autos</i> are not
"incomprehensible at all" (p. 112), but then he understands them all the better
for being a scholar and a churchman.</p>
<blockquote>
Sir F. H. Doyle thus continues his reference to Dr. Lorinser.&#160; "Even
 learned
critics", he says, "highly cultivated in all the niceties of &#230;sthetics, are
deficient in the knowledge of Catholic faith and Catholic theology properly to
understand Calderon" (<i>Lectures,</i> p. 110, taken from the Introduction to my
 volume,
p. 3).&#160; "Old traditions", continues Dr. Lorinzer, "which twine round the
dogma like a beautiful garland of legends, deeply profound thoughts expressed
here and there by some of the Fathers of the Church, are made use of
with such incredible skill and introduced so appositely at the right place,
that . . . . frequently it is not easy to guess the source from whence they have
been derived" (<i>Lectures,</i> p. 111, taken from the Introduction to my
 volume, p. 6).
</blockquote>
<p>This surely is unquestionably true, and the argument used by Sir F. H.
Doyle to controvert it does not go for much.&#160; These <i>Autos,</i> no doubt,
were, as he says, "composed in the first instance to gratify, and did gratify,
the uneducated populace of Madrid".&#160; Yes, the crowds that listened
delighted and entranced to these wonderful compositions, were, for the most
part, "uneducated" in the ordinary meaning of that word.&#160; But in the
special education necessary for their thorough enjoyment, the case was very
different.&#160; It is not too much to say that, as the result of Catholic
 training,
teaching, intuition, and association, the least instructed of his Madrid
 audience
more easily understood Calderon's allusions, than the great majority of those
who, reared up in totally different ideas, are able to do, even after much
 labour
and sometimes with considerable sympathy.&#160; Mr. Tennyson says that he
 counts&#8212;</p>
<center>
<font size="-1">"The gray barbarian lower than the Christian child",</font>
</center>
<p>because the almost intuitive perceptions of a Christian child as to the
 nature of
God and the truths of Revelation, place it intellectually higher than even the
mature intelligence of a savage.&#160; I mean no disrespect to Sir F. H. Doyle,
 but I
think that Calderon would have found at Madrid in the middle of the seventeenth
century, and would find there to-day, in a Catholic boy of fifteen, a more
intelligent and a better instructed critic on these points, than even the
 learned
professor himself.&#160; I shall make no further comments on Sir F. H. Doyle's
Lecture, but give his remarks on Calderon's <i>Autos</i> to the end.</p>
<blockquote>
"At the same time", says Sir F. H. Doyle, "Dr. Lorinzer's knowledge of
his subject is so profound, and his appreciation of his favourite author so
keen, that for me, who am almost entirely unacquainted with this branch
of literature, formally to oppose his views, would be an act of presumption,
of which I am, as I trust, incapable.&#160; I may, however, perhaps be permitted
to observe, that with regard to <i>the few pieces of this kind which in an
 English
dress I have read, whilst I think them not only most ingenious but also
 surprisingly
beautiful,</i> they do not strike me as incomprehensible at all.&#160; We must
accept them, of course, as coming from the mind of a devout Catholic and
Spanish gentleman, who belongs to the seventeenth century; but when once
that is agreed upon, there are no difficulties greater than those which we
might expect to find in any system of poetry so remote from our English
habits of thought.&#160; There is, for instance, the <i>Divine Philothea,</i> in
 other
words, our human spirit considered as the destined bride of Christ.&#160; This
sacred drama, we may well call it the swan-song of Calderon's extreme old
age, is steeped throughout in a serene power and a mellow beauty of style,
making it not unworthy to be ranked with that &#338;dipus Colon&#230;us which
glorified the sun-set of his illustrious predecessor: but yet, Protestant as I
am, I cannot discover that it is in the least obscure.&#160; Faith, Hope,
 Charity,
the Five Senses, Heresy, Judaism, Paganism, Atheism, and the like, which
in inferior hands must have been mere lay figures, are there instinct with a
 dramatic
life and energy such as beforehand I could hardly have supposed possible.&#160;
Moreover, in spite of Dr. Lorinzer's odd encomiums, each allegory as it
rises is more neatly rounded off, and shows a finer grain, than any of the
personifications of Spenser; so that the religious effect and the theological
effect intended by the writer, are both amply produced&#8212;yes, produced upon
us, his heretical admirers.&#160; Hence, even if there be mysterious treasures
 of
beauty below the surface, to which we aliens must remain blind for ever, this
expression, which broke from the lips of one to whom I was eagerly reading
[Mr. Mac-Carthy's translation of] the play, 'Why, in the original this
must be as grand as Dante', tends to show that such merits as do come
within our ken are not likely to be thrown away upon any fair-minded
Protestant.&#160; Dr. Newman, as a Catholic, will have entered, I presume,
more deeply still into the spirit of these extraordinary creations; his life,
however, belongs to a different era and to a colder people.&#160; And thus,
 however
much he may have been directed to the choice of a subject by the old Mysteries
and Moralities (of which these Spanish <i>Autos</i> must be taken as the
final development and bright consummate flower), he has treated that subject,
when once undertaken by him, entirely from his own point of view.&#160;
'Gerontius' is meant to be studied and dwelt upon by the meditative
 reader.&#160;
The <i>Autos</i> of Calderon were got ready by perhaps the most accomplished
playwright that ever lived, to amuse and stimulate a thronging southern
population.&#160; 'Gerontius' is, we may perhaps say for Dr. Newman in the words
 of
Shelley,
<center>
<p><font size="-1">'The voice of his own soul<br />
Heard in the calm of thought';</font></p>
</center>
whilst the conceptions of the Spanish dramatist burst into life with tumultuous
music, gorgeous scenery, and all the pomp and splendour of the Catholic
Church.&#160; No wonder therefore that our English <i>Auto,</i> though composed
 with
the same genuine purpose of using verse, and dramatic verse, to promote
a religious and even a theological end, should differ from them in essence as
well as in form.&#160; There is room however for both kinds in the wide
empire of Poetry, and though Dr. Newman himself would be the first to cry
shame upon me if I were to name him with Calderon even for a moment, still
his Mystery of this most unmysterious age will, I believe, keep its honourable
place in our English literature as an impressive, an attractive, and an original
production"&#8212;pp. 109, 115.

<p><img src="i.gif" align="left" alt="I" width="78" height="81" />N
the <i>Teatro escogido de Don Pedro Calderon de la
Barca</i> (1868), at present in course of publication by
the Royal Academy of Madrid, Calderon's dramas,
exclusive of the <i>autos sacramentales,</i> which do not
form a part of the collection, are divided into eight classes.&#160;
The seventh of these comprises what the editor calls mystical
dramas, and those founded on the Legends or the Lives of
Saints.&#160; The eighth contains the philosophical or purely ideal
dramas.&#160; This last division, in which the editor evidently
thinks the genius of Calderon attained its highest development,
at least as far as the secular theatre is concerned, contains
but two dramas, <i>The Wonder-working Magician,</i> and
<i>Life's a Dream.</i>&#160; The mystical dramas, which form the seventh
division, are more numerous, but of these five are at present
known to us only by name.&#160; Those that remain are <i>Day-break
in Copacabana, The Chains of the Demon, The Devotion of the
Cross, The Purgatory of St. Patrick, The Sibyl of the East, The
Virgin of the Sanctuary,</i> and <i>The Two Lovers of Heaven.</i>&#160; The
editor, Sr. D. P. De La Escosura, seems to think it necessary to
offer some apology for not including <i>The Two Lovers of Heaven</i>
among the philosophical instead of the mystical dramas.&#160; He
says: "There is a great analogy and, perhaps, resemblance between
<i>El Magico Prodigioso</i> (The Wonder-working Magician),
and <i>Los dos amantes del cielo</i> (The Two Lovers of Heaven);
but in the second, as it seems to us, the purely mystical predominates
in such a manner over the <i>philosophical,</i> that it does
not admit of its being classified in the same group as the first
(<i>El Magico Prodigioso</i>), and <i>La Vida es Sue&#241;o</i> (Life's a
 Dream)".&#160;
<i>Introduccion,</i> p. cxxxvii. note.&#160; Whether this distinction is
well founded or not it is unnecessary to determine.&#160; It is sufficient
for our purpose that it establishes the high position among
the greatest plays of Calderon of the drama which is here presented
to the English reader in the peculiar and always difficult
versification of the original.&#160; Whether less philosophical or
more mystical than <i>The Wonder-working Magician, The Two
Lovers of Heaven</i> possesses a charm of its own in which its
more famous rival seems deficient.&#160; In the admirable <i>Essay on
the Genius of Calderon</i> (ch. ii. p. 34), with which Archbishop
Trench introduces his spirited analysis of <i>La Vida es Sue&#241;o,</i> he
refers to the group of dramas which forms, with one exception,
the seventh and eighth divisions of the classification above
referred to, and pays a just tribute to the superior merits of <i>Los
dos amantes del cielo.</i>&#160; After alluding to the dramas, the argument
of which is drawn from the Old Testament, and especially
to <i>The Locks of Absalom,</i> which he considers the noblest specimen,
he continues:&#160; "Still more have to do with the heroic
martyrdoms and other legends of Christian antiquity, the victories
of the Cross of Christ over all the fleshly and spiritual
wickednesses of the ancient heathen world.&#160; To this theme,
which is one almost undrawn upon in our Elizabethan drama,&#8212;Massinger's
<i>Virgin Martyr</i> is the only example I remember,&#8212;he
returns continually, and he has elaborated these plays with
peculiar care.&#160; Of these <i>The Wonder-working Magician</i> is most
celebrated; but others, as <i>The Joseph of Women, The Two
Lovers of Heaven,</i> quite deserve to be placed on a level, if not
higher than it.&#160; A tender pathetic grace is shed over this last,
which gives it a peculiar charm.&#160; Then too he has occupied
what one might venture to call the region of sacred mythology,
as in <i>The Sibyl of the East,</i> in which the profound legends
identifying the Cross of Calvary and the Tree of Life are wrought
up into a poem of surpassing
beauty".<sup><a name="two" id="two"></a><a href="#two-note">2</a></sup>&#160;
An excellent German
version of <i>Los dos amantes del cielo</i> is to be found in the
second volume of the <i>Spanisches Theater,</i> by Schack, whose
important work on Dramatic Art and Literature in Spain, is still
untranslated into the language of that country,&#8212;a singular
neglect, when his later and less elaborate work, <i>Poesie and Kunst
der Araber in Spanien und Sicilien</i> (Berlin, 1865), has already
found an excellent Spanish interpreter in Don Juan Valera, two
volumes of whose <i>Poesia y Arte de los Arabes en Espa&#241;a y
Sicilia</i> (Madrid, 1868), I was fortunate enough to meet with
during a recent visit to Spain.</p>
<p>The story of SS. Chrysanthus and Daria (<i>The Two Lovers of
Heaven</i>), whose martyrdom took place at Rome A.D. 284, and
whose festival occurs on the 25th of October, is to be found in
a very abridged form in the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> of Jacobus de
Voragine, c. 152.&#160; The fullest account, and that which Calderon
had evidently before him when writing <i>The Two Lovers of
Heaven,</i> is given by Surius in his great work, <i>De Probatis
Sanctorum Vitis,</i> October, p. 378.&#160; This history is referred to by
Villegas at the conclusion of his own condensed narrative in the
following passage, which I take from the old English version of
his <i>Lives of Saints,</i> by John Heigham, anno 1630.</p>
<p>"The Church doth celebrate the feast of SS. Chrisanthus and
Daria, the 25th of October, and their death was in the year of
our Lord God 284, in the raigne of Numerianus, Emperor.&#160;
The martyrdom of these saints was written by Verinus and
Armenius, priests of St. Stephen, Pope and Martyr: Metaphrastes
enlarged it somewhat more.&#160; St. Damasus made certain
eloquent verses in praise of these saints, and set them on their
tombe.&#160; There is mention of them also in the Romaine Martirologe,
and in that of Usuardus: as also in the 5. tome of
Surius; in Cardinal Baronius, and Gregory of Turonensis", p. 849.</p>
<p>A different abridgment of the story as given by Surius, is to
be found in Ribadeneyra's <i>Flos Sanctorum</i> (the edition before me
being that of <i>Barcelona,</i> 1790, t. 3. p. 304).&#160; It concludes with
the same list of authorities, which, however, is given with more
precision.&#160; The old English translation by W. P. Esq., second
edition: London, 1730, p. 369, gives them thus:</p>
<p>"Surius in his fifth tome, and Cardinal Baronius in his <i>Annotations
upon the Martyrologies,</i> and in the second tome of his
<i>Annals,</i> and St. Gregory of Tours in his <i>Book of the Glory of
the Martyrs,</i> make mention of the Saints Chrysanthus and Daria".</p>
<p>The following is taken from Caxton's <i>Golden Legende,</i> or
translation of the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> of Jacobus de Voragine.&#160; I
have transcribed from the following edition, which is thus
described in the <i>Colophon:</i></p>
<p>"The legende named in latyn <i>Legenda Aurea,</i> that is to say
in englyshe <i>the golden legende,</i> For lyke as golde passeth all
other metalles, so this boke excedeth all other bokes".&#160; "Finyshed
the xxvii daye of August, the yere of our lord M. CCCCC.
XXVII, the xix yere of the regne of our souverayne lord
Kynge Henry the eyght.&#160; Imprynted at London in Flete Strete
at the Sygne of the Sonne by Wynkyn de Worde".</p>
<p>In the following extract the spelling is somewhat modernised,
and a few obsolete words are omitted.</p>

<p>"The Life of Saynt Crysant and Saynte Daria".<br />
Fo. cc. lxxxv.</p>
</center>
<p>"Here followeth the lyfe of Saynt Crysaunt, and fyrst of his
name.&#160; And of Saynte Daria, and of her name.</p>
<p>"Of Crysaunt is said as growen and multyplyed of God.&#160; For
when his father would have made hym do sacrifyce to the
idols, God gave to hym force and power to contrary and gaynsay
his father, and yield himself to God.&#160; Daria is sayd of dare
to give, for she gave her to two thynges.&#160; Fyrst will to do evil,
when she had will to draw Crysaunt to sacrifyce to the idols.&#160;
And after she gave her to good will when Crysaunt had converted
her to Almighty God.</p>
<p>"Crysaunt was son of a ryght noble man that was named
Polymne.&#160; And when his father saw that his son was taught in
the faith of Jesu Chryst, and that he could not withdraw him
therefrom, and make him do sacrifyce to the idols, he
commanded that he should be closed in a stronge hold and put to
hym five maidens for to seduce him with blandyshynge and
fayre wordes.&#160; And when he had prayed God that he should
not be surmounted with no fleshly desyre, anon these maydens
were so overcome with slepe, that they myght not take neither
meat ne drinke as long as they were there, but as soon as they
were out, they took both meat and drinke.&#160; And one Daria, a
noble and wise virgin of the goddess Vesta, arrayed her nobly
with clothes as she had been a goddess, and prayed that she
myght be letten enter in to Crysant and that she would restore
him to the idols and to his father.&#160; And when she was come
in, Crysant reproved her of the pride of her vesture.&#160; And she
answered that she had not done it for pride but for to draw him
to do sacrifyce to the idols and restore him to his father.&#160; And
then Crysant reproved her because she worshipped them as gods.&#160;
For they had been in their times evil and sinners.&#160; And Daria
answered, the philosophers called the elements by the names of
men.&#160; And Crysant said to her, if one worship the earth as a
goddess, and another work and labour the earth as a churl or
ploughman, to whom giveth the earth most?&#160; It is plain that
it giveth more to the ploughman than to him that worshippeth
it.&#160; And in like wise he said of the sea and of the other
elements.&#160; And then Crysant and Daria converted to him, coupled
them together by the grace of the Holy Ghost, and feigned to
be joined by carnal marriage, and converted many others to our
Lord.&#160; For Claudian, who had been one of their persecutors,
they converted to the faith of our Lord, with his wife and children
and many other knights.&#160; And after this Crysant was
enclosed in a stinking prison by the commandment of Numerian,
but the stink turned anon into a right sweet odour and savour.&#160;
And Daria was brought to the bordel, but a lion that was in the
amphitheatre came and kept the door of the bordel.&#160; And then
there was sent thither a man to befoul and corrupt the virgin, but
anon he was taken by the lion, and the lion began to look at
the virgin like as he demanded what he should do with the
caitiff.&#160; And the virgin commanded that he should do him no
hurt but let him go.&#160; And anon he was converted and ran
through the city, and began to cry that Daria was a goddess.&#160;
And then hunters were sent thither to take the lion.&#160; And they
anon fell down at the feet of the virgin and were converted by
her.&#160; And then the provost commanded them to make a great
fire within the entrance of the bordel, so that the lion should be
brent with Daria.&#160; And the lion considering this thing, felt
dread, and roaring took leave of the virgin, and went whither he
would without hurting of any body.&#160; And when the provost
had done to Crysant and Daria many diverse torments, and might
not grieve them, at the last they without compassion were put
in a deep pit, and earth and stones thrown on them.&#160; And so
were consecrated martyrs of Christ".</p>
<p>With regard to the exact year in which the martyrdom of
SS. Chrysanthus and Daria took place, it may be mentioned
that in the valuable <i>Vies des Saints,</i> Paris, 1701 (republished
in 1739), where the whole legend undergoes a very critical
examination, the generally received date, A.D. 284, is considered
erroneous.&#160; The reign of the emperor Numerianus (A.D.
283-284), in which it is alleged to have occurred, lasted but eight
months, during which period no persecution of the Christians is
recorded.&#160; The writer in the work just quoted (Adrien Baillet)
conjectures that the martyrdom of these saints took place in
the reign of Valerian, and not later than the month of August,
257, "s' il est vray que le pape Saint Etienne qui mourut alois
avoit donn&#233; ordre qu' on recueill&#238;t les actes de leur
martyre"&#8212;<i>Les Vies des Saints,</i> Paris, 1739, t. vii. p. 385.</p>

<p><b>Scene I.</b>&#8212;<i>A Room in the house of Polemius at Rome.</i></p>
</center>
<p><i>Chrysanthus is seen seated near a writing table on which are several
 books: he is reading a small volume with deep attention.</i></p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Ah! how shallow is my mind!<br />
How confined! and how restricted!<sup><a name="three" id="three"></a><a
 href="#three-note">3</a></sup><br />
Ah! how driftless are my words!<br />
And my thoughts themselves how driftless!<br />
Since I cannot comprehend,<br />
Cannot pierce the secrets hidden<br />
In this little book that I<br />
Found by chance with others mingled.<br />
I its meaning cannot reach,<br />
Howsoe'er my mind I rivet,<br />
Though to this, and this alone,<br />
Many a day has now been given.<br />
But I cannot therefore yield,<br />
Must not own myself outwitted:&#8212;<br />
No; a studious toil so great<br />
Should not end in aught so little.<br />
O'er this book my whole life long<br />
Shall I brood until the riddle<br />
Is made plain, or till some sage<br />
Simplifies what here is written.<br />
For which end I 'll read once more<br />
Its beginning.&#160; How my instinct<br />
Uses the same word with which<br />
Even the book itself beginneth!&#8212;<br />
"In the beginning was the Word" . .<sup><a name="four" id="four"></a><a
 href="#four-note">4</a></sup><br />
If in language plain and simple<br />
Word means speech, how then was <i>it</i><br />
In the beginning?&#160; Since a whisper<br />
Presupposes power to breathe it,<br />
Proves an earlier existence,<br />
And to that anterior Power<br />
Here the book doth not bear witness.<br />
Then this follows: "And the Word<br />
Was with God"&#8212;nay more, 't is written,<br />
"And the Word was God: was with Him<br />
In the beginning, and by <b>Him</b> then<br />
All created things were made<br />
And without Him naught was finshed":&#8212;<br />
Oh! what mysteries, what wonders,<br />
In this tangled labyrinthine<br />
Maze lie hid! which I so many<br />
Years have studied, with such mingled<br />
Aid from lore divine and human<br />
Have in vain tried to unriddle!&#8212;<br />
"In the beginning was the Word".&#8212;<br />
Yes, but when was this beginning?<br />
Was it when Jove, Neptune, Pluto<br />
Shared the triple zones betwixt them,<br />
When the one took to himself<br />
Heaven supreme, one hell's abysses,<br />
And the sea the third, to Ceres<br />
Leaving earth, the ever-wing&#233;d<br />
Time to Saturn, fire to Ph&#339;bus,<br />
And the air to Jove's great sister?<sup><a name="five" id="five"></a><a
 href="#five-note">5</a></sup>&#8212;<br />
No, it could not have been then,<br />
For the fact of their partition<br />
Shows that heaven and earth then <i>were,</i><br />
Shows that sea and land existed:&#8212;<br />
The beginning then must be<br />
Something more remote and distant:<br />
He who has expressly said<br />
<i>The beginning,</i> must have hinted<br />
At the primal cause of all things,<br />
At the first and great beginning,<br />
All things growing out of <b>Him,</b><br />
He himself the pre-existent:&#8212;<br />
Yes, but then a new beginning<br />
Must we seek for this beginner,<br />
And so on <i>ad infinitum;</i><br />
Since if I, on soaring pinion<br />
Seek from facts to rise to causes,<br />
Rising still from where I had risen,<br />
I will find at length there is<br />
No beginning to the beginning,<br />
And the inference that time<br />
Somehow <i>was,</i> ere time existed,<br />
And that that which ne'er begun<br />
Ne'er can end, is plain and simple.<br />
But, my thought, remain not here,<br />
Rest not in those narrow limits,<br />
But rise up with me and dare<br />
Heights that make the brain grow dizzy:&#8212;<br />
And at once to enter there,<br />
Other things being pretermitted,<br />
Let us venture where the mind,<br />
As the darkness round it thickens,<br />
Almost faints as we resume<br />
What this mystic scribe has written.<br />
"And the Word", this writer says,<br />
"Was made flesh!"&#160; Ah! how can <i>this</i> be?<br />
Could the Word that in the beginning<br />
Was with God, was God, was gifted<br />
With such power as to make all things,<br />
Could it be made flesh?&#160; In pity,<br />
Heavens! or take from me at once<br />
All the sense that you have given me,<br />
Or at once on me bestow<br />
Some intelligence, some glimmer<br />
Of clear light through these dark shadows:&#8212;<br />
Deity, unknown and hidden,<br />
God or Word, whate'er thou beest,<br />
Of Thyself the great beginner,<br />
Of Thyself the end, if, Thou<br />
Being Thyself beyond time's sickle,<br />
Still in time the world didst fashion,<br />
If Thou 'rt life, O living spirit,<br />
If Thou 'rt light, my darkened senses<br />
With Thy life and light enkindle!&#8212;<br />

What this crabbed text here meaneth<br />

It is Jove to whose great voice<br />

What the holy Gospel means<br />

Who was in Himself for ever,<br />

Oh! what darkness, what confusion,<br />

'Gainst each other!&#160; Spirits twain<br />

Spirits twain of good and ill,&#8212;<br />

To believe, but, oh! the other<br />

Yes, Carpophorus must pay<br />
For the trouble that this gives me.&#8212;</p>

Though these words by chance were spoken<br />
As an omen I 'll admit them:<br />
Since Carpophorus (who in Rome<br />
Was the most renowned, most gifted<br />
Master in all science), now<br />
Flying from the emperor's lictors,<br />
Through suspect of being a Christian,<br />
In lone deserts wild and dismal<br />
Lives a saintly savage life,<br />
He will give to all my wishes<br />
The solution of these doubts:&#8212;<br />
And till then, O restless thinking<br />
Torture me and tease no more!<br />
Let me live for that!&#160; [<i>His voice gradually rises.</i></p>

This decree, which bids me search<br />

That excuse will scarce acquit thee,<br />
Since when one 's alone, excitement<br />
Is a flame that 's seldom kindled.<br />
I am pleased, well pleased to see thee<br />

Solely in these idle whimseys?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Sir, the state in which you see me,<br />
This secluded room, this stillness,<br />
Do not spring from want of feeling,<br />
Or indifference to your wishes.<br />
'T is my natural disposition;<br />
For I have no taste to mingle<br />
In the vulgar vain pursuits<br />
Of the courtier crowds ambitious.<br />
And if living to myself here<br />
More of true enjoyment gives me,<br />
Why would you desire me seek for<br />
That which must my joys diminish?<br />
Let this time of sadness pass,<br />
Let these hours of lonely vigil,<br />
Then for fame and its applauses,<br />
Which no merit of my own,<br />
But my father's name may bring me.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Would it not, my son, be fitter<br />
That you should enjoy those plaudits<br />
In the fresh and blooming spring-time<br />
Of your life, and to hereafter<br />
Leave the loneliness and vigil?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Let me tell a little story<br />
Which will make the whole thing simple:&#8212;<br />
A bad painter bought a house,<br />
Altogether a bad business,<br />
For the house itself was bad:<br />
He however was quite smitten<br />
With his purchase, and would show it<br />
To a friend of his, keen-witted,<br />
But bad also: when they entered,<br />
The first room was like a kitchen,<br />
Black and bad:&#8212;"This room, you see, sir,<br />
Now is bad, but just permit me<br />
First to have it whitewashed over,<br />
Then shall my own hand with pictures<br />
Paint the walls from floor to ceiling,<br />
Then you 'll see how bright 't will glisten".&#8212;<br />
To him thus his friend made answer,<br />
Smiling archly: "Yes, 't will glisten,<br />
But if you would paint it first,<br />
And then whitewash o'er the pictures,<br />
The effect would be much better".&#8212;<br />
Now 's the time for you, my lord,<br />
To lay on the shining pigment:<br />
On that brilliant ground hereafter<br />
Will the whitewash fall more fitly,<br />
For, in fine, the poorest painting<br />
Is improved by time's slow finger.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Sir, I say, that in obedience<br />
To your precepts, to your wishes,<br />
I will strive from this day forward<br />
So to act, that you will think me<br />
Changed into another being.&#160; [<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Claudius, my paternal instinct<br />
Makes me fear Chrysanthus' sadness,<br />
Makes we tremble that its issue<br />
May result in total madness.<br />
Since thou art his friend and kinsman<br />
Both combined, make out, I pray thee,<br />
What occasions this bewitchment,<br />
To the end that I may break it:<br />
And my promise now I give thee,<br />
That although I should discover<br />
Love's delirious dream delicious<br />
May be at the root,&#8212;most likely<br />
At his age the true suspicion,&#8212;<br />
It shall not disturb or grieve me.<br />
Nay, since I am doomed to witness<br />
His dejection, it will glad me<br />
To find out that so it springeth.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Once a high priest of Apollo<br />
Had two nephews soft and silly,<br />
More than silly, wretched creatures,<br />
More than wretched, doltish drivels;<br />
And perceiving from experience<br />
How love smartens up its victims,<br />
He but said to them this only,<br />
"Fall in love at least, ye ninnies".&#8212;<br />
Thus, though not in love, sir, now,<br />
I 'll be bound he 'll be so quickly,<br />
Merely to oblige you.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />This<br />
Is not quite as I would wish it,<br />
For when anything has happened,<br />
The desire to know it, differs<br />
From the wish it so should happen.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
I, my lord, my best assistance<br />
Offer thee to strive and fathom<br />
From what cause can have arisen<br />
Such dejection and such sadness;<br />
This henceforth shall be my business<br />
To divert him and distract him.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Such precisely are my wishes:<br />
And since now I am forced to go<br />
In obedience to the mission<br />
Sent me by Numerianus,<br />
'Mid the wastes to search for Christians,<br />
In my absence, Claudius,<br />
Most consoling thoughts 't will give me,<br />
To remember that thou watchest<br />
O'er Chrysanthus.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="100" height="1" alt="100 pixel" />From this

Stealthily and with all quickness<br />
To the spot, for all must perish<br />
Who are there found hiding with him:&#8212;<br />
For the care with which, ye Heavens!<br />
I uphold the true religion<br />
Of the gods, their faith and worship,<br />
For the zeal that I exhibit<br />
In thus crushing Christ's new law,<br />
Which I hate with every instinct<br />
Of my soul, oh! grant my guerdon<br />
In the cure of my son's illness!&#160; [<i>Exeunt Polemius and Aurelius.</i></p>
<p><b>Claudius</b> (<i>to Escarpin</i>).<br />
Go and tell my lord Chrysanthus<br />
That I wish he would come with me<br />
Forth to-day for relaxation.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Relaxation! just say whither<br />
Are we to go forth to get it;<br />
Of that comfort I get little&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Outside Rome, Diana's temple<br />
On the Salarian way uplifteth<br />
Its majestic front: the fairest<br />
Of our Roman maids dwell in it:<br />
'T is the custom, as thou knowest,<br />
That the loveliest of Rome's children<br />
Whom patrician blood ennobles,<br />
From their tender years go thither<br />
To be priestesses of the goddess,<br />
Living there till 't is permitted<br />
They should marry: 't is the centre<br />
Of all charms, the magic circle<br />
Drawn around a land of beauty&#8212;<br />
Home of deities&#8212;Elysium!&#8212;<br />
And as great Diana is<br />
Goddess of the groves, her children<br />
Have to her an altar raised<br />
In the loveliest cool green thicket.<br />
Thither, when the evening falleth,<br />
And the season is propitious,<br />
Various squadrons of fair nymphs<br />
Hasten: and it is permitted<br />
Gallant youths, unmarried also,<br />
As an escort to go with them.<br />
There this evening will I lead him.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Well, I doubt that your prescription<br />
Is the best: for fair recluses,<br />
Whose sublime pursuits, restricted<br />
To celestial things, make even<br />
The most innocent thought seem wicked,<br />
Are by no means likely persons<br />
To divert a man afflicted<br />
With this melancholy madness:<br />
Better take him into the thickest<br />
Throng of Rome, there flesh and bone<br />
Goddesses he 'll find, and fitter.&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Ah! you speak but as the vulgar:<br />
Is it not the bliss of blisses<br />
To adore some lovely being<br />
In the ideal, in the distance,<br />
Almost as a vision?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="160" height="1" alt="160 pixel" />Yes;<br />
'T is delightful; I admit it,<br />
But there 's good and better: think<br />
Of the choice that once a simple<br />
Mother gave her son: she said:<br />
"Egg or rasher, which will I give thee?"<br />
And he said: "The rasher, mother,<br />
But with the egg upon it, prithee".<br />
"Both are best", so says the proverb.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Well, if tastes did n't sometimes differ,<br />
What a notable mistake<br />
Providence would have committed!<br />
To adore thee, sweetest Cynthia, [<i>aside</i><br />

Yes.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />

In this tranquil forest sphere,<br />
Where the boughs and blossoms blent,<br />
Ruby blooms and emerald stems,<br />
Round about their radiance fling,<br />
Where the canopy of spring<br />
Breathes of flowers and gleams with gems,<br />
Here I wish that air to play,<br />
Which to words that Cynthia wrote<br />
I have set&#8212;a simple note.</p>

<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />A touching

How a nightingale in a grove<br />
Singing sweetly of his love,<br />
Sang its pleasure and its pain.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> <b>Cynthia</b> (<i>reading in a book</i>).</p>
<p><b>Cynthia</b> (<i>to herself</i>).<br />
Whilst each alley here discloses<br />
Youthful nymphs, who as they pass<br />
To Diana's shrine, the grass<br />
Turn to beds of fragrant roses,&#8212;<br />
Where the interlac&#233;d bars<br />
Of these woods their beauty dowers<br />
Seem a verdant sky of flowers&#8212;<br />
Seem an azure field of stars.<br />
I shall here recline and read<br />
(While they wander through the grove)<br />
Ovid's <i>Remedy of Love.</i></p>

O nightingale, whose sweet exulting strain<br />
Tells of thy triumphs to the listening grove,<br />
Thou fill'st my heart with envy and with pain.<br />
But no; but no; for if thou sing'st of love,<br />
Jealousy's pangs and sorrow's tears remain.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia</b> (<i>advancing</i>).<br />
What a charming air!&#160; To me<br />
What an honour!&#160; From this day<br />
I may well be vain, as they<br />
May without presumption be,<br />
Who, despite their numerous slips,<br />
Find their words can please the ear,<br />
Who their rugged verses hear<br />
Turn to music on thy lips.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
'T is thine own genius, not my skill,<br />
That produces this effect;<br />
For, without it, I suspect,<br />
Would my voice sound harsh and shrill,<br />
And my lute's strings should be broken<br />
With a just and wholesome rigour,<br />
For presuming to disfigure<br />
What thy words so well have spoken.<br />
Whither wert thou wending here?</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Through the quiet wood proceeding,<br />
I the poet's book was reading,<br />
When there fell upon my ear,<br />
Soft and sweet, thy voice: its power,<br />
Gentle lodestone of my feet,<br />
Brought me to this green retreat&#8212;<br />
Led me to this lonely bower:<br />
But what wonder, when to listen<br />
To thy sweetly warbled words<br />
Ceased the music of the birds&#8212;<br />
Of the founts that glide and glisten?<br />
May I hope that, since I came<br />
Thus so opportunely near,<br />
I the gloss may also hear?</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
I will sing it, though with shame.</p>
<p>(<i>Sings</i>)<br />
Sweet nightingale, that from some echoing grot<br />
Singest the rapture of thy love aloud,<br />
Singest with voice so joyous and so proud,<br />
All unforgetting thou mayst be forgot,<br />
Full of thyself and of thy happy lot!<br />
Ah! when thou trillest that triumphant strain<br />
To all the listening lyrists of the grove,<br />
Thou fill'st my heart with envy and with pain!<br />
But no; but no; for if thou sing'st of love.<br />
Jealousy's pangs and sorrow's tears remain!</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> <b>Daria.</b></p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Ah! my Nisida, forbear,<br />
Ah! those words forbear to sing,<br />
Which on zephyr's wanton wing<br />
Thou shouldst waft not on the air.<br />
All is wrong, how sweet it be,<br />
That the vestal's thoughts reprove:<br />
What is jealousy? what is love?<br />
That they should be sung by thee?<br />
Think this wood is consecrated<br />
To Diana's service solely,<br />
Not to Venus: it is holy.<br />
Why then wouldst thou desecrate it<br />
With thy songs?&#160; Does 't not amaze<br />
Thee thyself&#8212;this strangest thing&#8212;<br />
In Diana's grove to sing<br />
Hymns of love to Cupid's praise?<br />
But I need not wonder, no,<br />
That thou 'rt so amused, since I<br />
Here see Cynthia with thee.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="160" height="1" alt="160 pixel" />Why<br />
Dost thou say so?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />I say so<br />
For good cause: in books profane<br />
Thou unceasingly delightest,<br />
Verse thou readest, verse thou writest,<br />
Of their very vanity vain.<br />
And if thou wouldst have me prove<br />
What I say to thy proceeding,<br />
Tell me, what 's this book thou 'rt reading?</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
'T is <i>The Remedy of Love.</i><br />
Whence thou mayst perceive how weak<br />
Is thy inference, thy deduction<br />
From my studious self-instruction;<br />
Since the patient who doth seek<br />
Remedies to cure his pain<br />
Shows by this he <i>would</i> grow better;&#8212;<br />
For the slave who breaks his fetter<br />
Cannot surely love his chain.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
This, though not put quite so strong,<br />
Was involved in the conclusion<br />
Of my lay: Love's disillusion<br />
Was the burden of my song.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Remedies and disillusions,<br />
Seek ye both beneath one star?<br />
Ah! if so, you are not far<br />
From its pains and its confusions:<br />
For the very fact of pleading<br />
Disillusion, shows that thou<br />
'Neath illusion's yoke doth bow,&#8212;<br />
And the patient who is needing<br />
Remedies doth prove that still<br />
The sharp pang he doth endure,<br />
For there 's no one seeks a cure<br />
Ere he feels that he is ill:&#8212;<br />
Therefore to this wrong proceeding<br />
Grieved am I to see ye clinging&#8212;<br />
Seeking <i>thou</i> thy cure in singing&#8212;<br />
<i>Thou</i> thy remedy in reading.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Casual actions of this class<br />
That are done without intention<br />
Of a second end, to mention<br />
Here were out of place: I pass<br />
To another point: There 's no one<br />
Who <i>with</i> genius, or denied it,&#8212;<br />
Dowered with mind, but has applied it<br />
Some especial track to go on:<br />
This variety suffices<br />
For its exercise and action,<br />
Just as some by free attraction<br />
Seek the virtues and the vices;&#8212;<br />
This blind instinct, or this duty,<br />
We three share;&#8212;'t is <i>thy</i> delight<br />
Nisida to sing,&#8212;to write<br />
<i>Mine,</i>&#8212;and <i>thine</i> to adore thy beauty.<br />
Which of these three occupations<br />
Is the best&#8212;or those that need<br />
Skill and labour to succeed,<br />
Or thine own vain contemplations?&#8212;<br />
Have I not, when morning's rays<br />
Gladdened grove and vale and mountain,<br />
Seen thee in the crystal fountain<br />
At thyself enamoured gaze?<br />
Wherefore, once again returning<br />
To our argument of love,<br />
Thou a greater pang must prove,<br />
If from thy insatiate yearning<br />
I infer a cause: the spell<br />
Lighter falls on one who still,<br />
To herself not feeling ill,<br />
Would in other eyes seem well.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Ah! so far, so far from me<br />
Is the wish as vain as weak&#8212;<br />
(Now my virtue doth not speak,<br />
Now but speaks my vanity),<br />
Ah! so far, I say, my breast<br />
Turns away from things of love,<br />
That the sovereign hand of Jove,<br />
Were it to attempt its best,<br />
Could no greater wonder work,<br />
Than that I, Daria, should<br />
So be changed in mind and mood<br />
As to let within me lurk<br />
Love's minutest, smallest seed:&#8212;<br />
Only upon one condition<br />
Could I love, and that fruition<br />
Then would be my pride indeed.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
What may that condition be?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
When of all mankind, I knew<br />
One who felt a love so true<br />
As to give his life for me,<br />
Then, until my own life fled,<br />
Him, with gratitude and pride,<br />
Were I sure that so he died,<br />
I would love though he were dead.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Poor reward for love so great<br />
Were that tardy recollection,<br />
Since, it seems, for thy affection<br />
He, till life is o'er, must wait.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Soars thy vanity so high?<br />
Thy presumption is above<br />
All belief: be sure, for love<br />
No man will be found to die.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Why more words then? love must be<br />
In my case denied by heaven:<br />
Since my love cannot be given<br />
Save to one who 'll die for me.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Thy ambition is a thing<br />
So sublime, what <i>can</i> be said?&#8212;<br />
Better I resumed and read,<br />
Better, Nisida, thou shouldst sing,<br />
This disdain so strange and strong,<br />
This delusion little heeding.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Yes, do thou resume thy reading,<br />
I too will resume my song.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
I, that I may not renew<br />
Such reproaches, whilst you sing,<br />
Whilst you read, in this clear spring<br />
Thoughtfully myself shall view.</p>

O nightingale, whose sweet exulting strain<br />
Tells of thy triumphs to the listening grove,<br />

Equally fair by distance made.<br />
Of these that chain our willing feet,<br />

One is a lady calmly reading,<br />
One is a lady singing sweet,<br />

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
I do not know: for in one way<br />

So musical and fair and wise,<br />
That while one captivates the mind,<br />
One works her witcheries with the wind,<br />
And one, the fairest, charms our eyes.<br />
The one who sings, it seems a duty,<br />
Trusting her sweet voice, to think sweet,<br />
The one who reads, to deem discreet,<br />
The third, we judge but by her beauty:<br />
And so I fear by act or word<br />
To wrong the three by judging ill,<br />
Of one her charms, of one her skill,<br />
And the intelligence of the third.<br />

Forced, but most unwillingly<br />
(As to listening heaven is plain)<br />
To reply:&#8212;a bootless task<br />
Were it in me, indeed, to ask,<br />
Since, whoe'er you be, my strain<br />
Must be one of proud disdain.<br />
So I pray you, cavalier,<br />
Leave me in this lonely wood,<br />
Leave me in the solitude<br />
I enjoyed ere you came here.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Sweetly, but with tone severe,<br />
Thus my error you reprove&#8212;<br />
That of asking in this grove<br />
What your name is: you 're so fair,<br />
That, whatever name you bear,<br />
I must tell you of my love.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Love! a word to me unknown,<br />
Sounds so strangely in my ears,<br />
That my heart nor feels nor hears<br />
Aught of it when it has flown.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Then there is no rashness shown<br />
In repeating it once more,<br />
Since to hear or to ignore<br />
Suits alike your stoic coldness.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Yes, the speech, but not the boldness<br />
Of the speaker I pass o'er,<br />
For this word, whate'er it be,<br />
When it breaks upon my ear,<br />
Quick 't is gone, although I hear.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
You forget it?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
What! love's sweetest word! ah, me!<br />
Canst forget the mightiest ray<br />
Death can dart, or heaven display?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Yes, for lightning, entering where<br />
Naught resists, is lost in air.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
How? what way?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />Well, in this
 way:<br />
If two doors in one straight line<br />
Open lie, and lightning falls,<br />
Then the bolt between the walls<br />
Passes through, and leaves no sign.<br />
So 't is with this word of thine;<br />
Though love be, which I do n't doubt,<br />
Like heaven's bolt that darts about,<br />
Still two opposite doors I 've here,<br />
And what enters by one ear<br />
By the other ear goes out.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
If this lightning then darts through<br />
Where no door lies open wide<br />
To let it pass at the other side,<br />
Must not fire and flame ensue?<br />
This being so, 't is also true<br />
That the fire of love that flies<br />
Into my heart, in flames must rise,<br />
Since without its feast of fire<br />
The fatal flash cannot retire,<br />
That has entered by the eyes.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
If to what I said but now<br />
You had listened, I believe<br />
You would have preferred to leave<br />
Still unspoken love's vain vow.<br />
This you would yourself allow.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
What then was it?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />I do n't
 know:<br />
Something 't was that typified<br />
My presumption and my pride.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Let me know it even so.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
That in me no love could grow<br />
Save for one who first would die<br />
For my love.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />And death being
 past,<br />
Would he win your love at last?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Yes, on that he might rely.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Then I plight my troth that I<br />
Will to that reward aspire,&#8212;<br />
A poor offering at the fire<br />
By those beauteous eyes supplied.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />

Nature here takes little trouble,<br />
Letting it be seen how perfect<br />
Is the beauty that arises<br />
Even from nature's careless efforts:<br />
Deep within this darksome grotto<br />
Which no sunbeam's light can enter,<br />

As if until now it never<br />

Carries with it the white freshness<br />

To the tree-trunks near it is,<br />

Sir, as long as I remember,<br />
I have felt an inclination<br />
To the love of books and letters.<br />
In my casual studies lately<br />
I a difficulty met with<br />
That I could not solve, and knowing<br />
No one in all Rome more learn&#233;d<br />
Than thyself (thy reputation<br />
Having with this truth impressed me)<br />
I have hither come to ask thee<br />
To explain to me this sentence:<br />
For I cannot understand it.<br />
'T is, sir, in this book.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />

 it<br />
To my forehead, thus suggesting<br />
The profound respect with which<br />
I even touch so great a treasure.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Why, what <i>is</i> the book, which I<br />
By mere accident selected?</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
'T is the basis, the foundation<br />
Of the Scripture Law.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />

With an unknown horror.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Deeper now I would not enter<br />
Into the secrets of a book<br />
Which are magic spells, I 'm certain.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
No, not so, but vital truths.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
How can <i>that</i> be, when its verses<br />
Open with this line that says<br />
(A beginning surely senseless)<br />
"In the beginning was the Word,<br />
And it was with God": and <i>then</i> it<br />
Adds: this Word itself was God;<br />
Then unto the Word reverting,<br />
Says explicitly that <b>It</b><br />
"Was made flesh"?</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="60" height="1" alt="60 pixel" />A truth most
 certain:<br />
For this first evangelist<br />
Here to us our God presenteth<br />
In a twofold way: the first<br />
As being God, as Man the second.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
God and Man combined together?</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
Yes, in one eternal Person<br />
Are both natures joined together.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Then, for this is what more presses<br />
On my mind, can that same Word<br />
When it was made flesh, be reckoned<br />
God?</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="40" height="1" alt="40 pixel" />Yes, God and Man is
 Christ<br />
Crucified for our transgressions.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Pray explain this wondrous problem.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
He is God, because He never<br />
Was created: He is the Word,<br />
For, besides, He was engendered<br />
By the Father, from both whom<br />
In eternal due procession<br />
Comes the Holy Ghost, three Persons,<br />
But one God, thrice mystic emblem!&#8212;<br />
In the Catholic faith we hold<br />
In one Trinity one God dwelleth,<br />
And that in one God is also<br />
One sole Trinity, ever bless&#233;d,<br />
Which confounds not the three Persons,<br />
Nor the single substance severs.<br />
One is the person of the Father,<br />
One the Son's, beloved for ever,<br />
One, the third, the Holy Ghost's.<br />
But though three, you must remember<br />
That in the Father, and in the Son,<br />
And in the Holy Ghost . . .</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />Unheard of<br />
Mysteries these!</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />There 's but one
 God,<br />
Equal in the power exerted,<br />
Equal in the state and glory;<br />
For . . .</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="40" height="1" alt="40 pixel" />I listen, but I
 tremble.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
The eternal Father is<br />
Limitless, even so unmeasured<br />
And eternal is the Son,<br />
And unmeasured and eternal<br />
Is the Holy Ghost; but then<br />
Three eternities are not meant here,<br />
Three immensities, no, but One,<br />
Who is limitless and eternal.<br />
For though increate the three,<br />
They are but one Uncreated.<br />
First the Father was not made,<br />
Or created, or engendered;<br />
Then engendered was the Son<br />
By the Father, not created;<br />
And the Spirit was not made<br />
Or created, or engendered<br />
By the Father or the Son,<br />
But proceeds from both together.<br />
This is God's divinity<br />
Viewed as God alone, let 's enter<br />
On the human aspect.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />Stay:<br />
For so strange, so unexpected<br />
Are the things you say, that I<br />
Need for their due thought some leisure.<br />
Let me my lost breath regain,<br />
For entranced, aroused, suspended,<br />
Spell-bound your strong reasons hold me.<br />

In three Persons, one in essence,<br />
One in substance, one in power,<br />

<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />What!<br />
With Daria?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />'T is no

What her name is, or Daria<br />
Or Maria, I would have her<br />
Both subjective and subjunctive,<br />
She verb passive, I verb active.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
You to love so rare a beauty?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Yes, her beauty, though uncommon,<br />
Would lack something, if it had not<br />
My devotion.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />How?
 explain:&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Well, I prove it in this manner:&#8212;<br />
Mr. Dullard fell in love<br />
(I do n't tell where all this happened,<br />
Or the time, for of the Dullards<br />
Every age and time give samples)<br />
With a very lovely lady:<br />
At her coach-door as he chattered<br />
One fine evening, he such nonsense<br />
Talked, that one who heard his clatter,<br />
Asked the lady in amazement<br />
If this simpleton's advances<br />
Did not make her doubt her beauty?&#8212;<br />
But she quite gallantly answered,<br />
Never until now have I<br />
Felt so proud of my attractions,<br />
For no beauty can be perfect<br />
That all sorts of men do n't flatter.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
What a feeble jest!</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />This
 feeble?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Yes, the very type of flatness:&#8212;<br />
Cease buffooning, for my uncle<br />
Here is coming.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />Of his
 sadness<br />
Plainly is his face the mirror.</p>
<p><i>Enter Polemius and servants.</i></p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Jupiter doth know the anguish,<br />
My good lord, with which I venture<br />
To approach thee since this happened.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Claudius, as thine own, I 'm sure,<br />
Thou dost feel this great disaster.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
I my promise gave thee that<br />
To Chrysanthus . . .</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="100" height="1" alt="100 pixel" />Cease; I ask
 thee<br />
Not to proffer these excuses,<br />
Since I do not care to have them.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Then it seems that all thy efforts<br />
Have been useless to unravel<br />
The strange mystery of his fate?</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
With these questions do not rack me;<br />
For, though I would rather not<br />
Give the answer, still the answer<br />
Rises with such ready aptness<br />
To my lips from out my heart,<br />
That I scarcely can withstand it.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Why conceal it then from me,<br />
Knowing that thy blood meanders<br />
Through my veins, and that my life<br />
Owns thee as its lord and master?&#8212;<br />
Oh! my lord, confide in me,<br />
Let thy tongue speak once the language<br />
That thine eyes so oft have spoken.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Let the servants leave the apartment.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
Ah! if beautiful Daria<br />
Would but favour my attachment,<br />
Though I have no house to give her,<br />
Lots of stories I can grant her:&#8212; [<i>Exeunt Escarpin and
 servants.</i></p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Now, my lord, we are alone.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Listen then; for though to baffle<br />
Thy desire were my intention,<br />
By my miseries overmastered,<br />
I am forced to tell my secret;<br />
Not so much have I been granted<br />
License to avow my sufferings,<br />
But I am, as 't were commanded<br />
Thus to break my painful silence,<br />
Doing honestly, though sadly,<br />
Willingly the fact disclosing,<br />
Which by force had been extracted.<br />
Hear it, Claudius: my Chrysanthus,<br />
My Chrysanthus is not absent:<br />
In this very house he 's living!&#8212;<br />
Would the gods, ah! me, had rather<br />
Made a tomb and not a prison<br />
Of his present locked apartment!<br />
Which is in this house, within it<br />
Is he prisoned, chained, made captive.<br />
This surprises thee, no wonder:<br />
More surprised thou 'lt be hereafter,<br />
When thou com'st to know the reason<br />
Of a fact so strange and startling.<br />
On that fatal day, when I<br />
Sought the mount and thou the garden,<br />
Him I found where thou didst lose him,<br />
Near the wood where he had rambled:<br />
He was taken by my soldiers<br />
At the entrance of a cavern,<br />
With Carpophorus:&#8212;oh! here<br />
Patience, patience may heaven grant me!&#8212;<br />
It was lucky that they did not<br />
See his face, for thus it happened<br />
That the front of my dishonour<br />
Was not in his face made patent:<br />
Him they captured without knowing<br />
Who he was, it being commanded<br />
That the faces of the prisoners<br />
Should be covered, but ere captured<br />
This effectually was done<br />
By themselves, they flying backward<br />
With averted faces; he<br />
Thus was taken, but his partner,<br />
That strange prodigy of Rome&#8212;<br />
Man in mind, wild beast in manners,<br />
Doubly thus a prodigy&#8212;<br />
Saved himself by power of magic.<br />
Thus Chrysanthus was sole prisoner,<br />
While the Christian crowd, disheartened,<br />
Fled for safety to the mountains<br />
From their grottoes and their caverns.<br />
These the soldiers quickly followed,<br />
And behind in that abandoned<br />
Savage place remained but two&#8212;<br />
Two, oh! think, a son and father.&#8212;<br />
One a judge, too, in a cause<br />
Wicked, bad, beyond example,<br />
In a cause that outraged C&#230;sar,<br />
And the gods themselves disparaged.<br />
There with a delinquent son<br />
Stood I, therefore this should happen,<br />
That both clemency and rigour<br />
In my heart waged fearful battle&#8212;<br />
Clemency in fine had won,<br />
I would have removed the bandage<br />
From his eyes and let him fly,<br />
But that instant, ah! unhappy!<br />
Came the soldiers back, and then<br />
It were but more misery added,<br />
If they knew of my connivance:<br />
All that then my care could manage<br />
To protect him was the secret<br />
Of his name to keep well guarded.<br />
Thus to Rome I brought him prisoner,<br />
Where pretending great exactness,<br />
That his friends should not discover<br />
Where this Christian malefactor<br />
Was imprisoned, to this house,<br />
To my own house, I commanded<br />
That he should be brought; there hidden<br />
And unknown, a few days after<br />
I in <i>his</i> place substituted . . .<br />
Ah! what will not the untrammelled<br />
Strength of arbitrary power<br />
Dare attempt? what law not trample?<br />
Substituted, I repeat,<br />
For my son a slave, whose strangled,<br />
Headless corse thus paid the debt<br />
Which from me were else exacted.<br />
You will say, "Since fortune thus<br />
Has the debt so happily cancelled,<br />
Why imprison or conceal him?"&#8212;<br />
And, thus, full of doubts, I answer<br />
That though it is true I wished not,<br />
Woe is me! the common scaffold<br />
Should his punishment make public,<br />
I as little wished his hardened<br />
Heart should know my love and pity<br />
Since it did not fear my anger:<br />
Ah! believe me, Claudius,<br />
'Twixt the chastisement a father<br />
And an executioner gives,<br />
A great difference must be granted:<br />
One hand honours what it striketh,<br />
One disgraces, blights, and blackens.<br />
Soon my rigour ceased, for truly,<br />
In a father's heart it lasteth<br />
Seldom long: but then what wonder,<br />
If the hand that in its anger<br />
Smites his son, in his own breast<br />
Leaves a wound that ever rankles&#8212;<br />
I one day his prison entered<br />
With the wish (I own it frankly)<br />
To forgive him, and when I<br />
Thought he would have even thanked me<br />
For receiving a reproof,<br />
Not severe, too lenient rather,<br />
He began to praise the Christians<br />
With such earnestness and ardour,<br />
In defence of their new law,<br />
That my clemency departed,<br />
And my angrier mood returned.<br />
I his doors and windows fastened.<br />
In the room where he is lying,<br />
Well secured by gyves and shackles,<br />
Sparingly his food is given him,<br />
Through my hands alone it passes,<br />
For I dare not to another<br />
Trust the care his state demandeth.<br />
You will think in this I reached to<br />
The extreme of my disasters&#8212;<br />
The full limits of misfortune,<br />
But not so, and if you hearken,<br />
You 'll perceive they 're but beginning,<br />
And not ended, as you fancied.<br />
All these strange events so much<br />
Have unnerved him and unmanned him,<br />
That, forgetful of himself,<br />
Of himself he is regardless.<br />
Nothing to the purpose speaks he.<br />
In his incoherent language<br />
Frenzy shows itself, delusion<br />
In his thoughts and in his fancies:&#8212;<br />
Many times I 've listened to him,<br />
Since so high-strung and abstracted<br />
Is his mind, he takes no note of<br />
Who goes in or who departeth.<br />
Once I heard him deprecating<br />
Some despotic beauty's hardness,<br />
Saying, "Since I die for thee,<br />
Thou thy favour sure wilt grant me".<br />
At another time he said,<br />
"Three in one, oh! how can <i>that</i> be?"<br />
Things which these same Christian people<br />
In their law hold quite established.<br />
Thus it is my life is troubled,<br />
Lost in doubts, emeshed, and tangled.<br />
If to freedom I restore him,<br />
I have little doubt that, darkened<br />
By the Christian treachery, he<br />
Will declare himself instanter<br />
Openly a Christian, which<br />
Would to me be such a scandal,<br />
That my blood henceforth were tainted,<br />
And my noble name were branded.<br />
If I leave him here in prison,<br />
So excessive is his sadness,<br />
So extreme his melancholy,<br />
That I fear 't will end in madness.<br />
In a word, I hold, my nephew,<br />
Hold it as a certain axiom,<br />
That these dark magician Christians<br />
Keep him bound by their enchantments;<br />
Who through hatred of my house,<br />
And my office to disparage,<br />
Now revenge themselves on me<br />
Through my only son Chrysanthus.<br />
Tell me, then, what shall I do;<br />
But before you give the answer<br />
Which your subtle wit may dictate,<br />
I would with your own eyes have thee<br />
See him first, you 'll then know better<br />
What my urgent need demandeth.<br />
Come, he 's not far off, his quarter<br />
Is adjoining this apartment;<br />
When you see him, I am certain<br />
You will think it a disaster<br />
Far less evil he should die,<br />
Than that in this cruel manner<br />
He should outrage his own blood,<br />
And my bright escutcheon blacken.<br />
[<i>He opens a door, and Chrysanthus is seen seated in a chair, with his hands
 and feet in irons.</i>]</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Thus to see my friend, o'erwhelms me<br />
With a grief I cannot master.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Stay, do not approach him nearer;<br />
For I would not he remarked thee,<br />
I would save him the disgrace<br />
Of being seen by thee thus shackled.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
What his misery may dictate<br />
We can hear, nor yet attract him.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Was ever human fate so strange as mine?<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />Were unmatched
 wishes ever mated so?<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />Is it not enough to
 feel one form of woe,<br />
Without being forced 'neath opposite forms to pine?<br />
A triune God's mysterious power divine,<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />From heaven I ask
 for life, that I may know,<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />From heaven I ask
 for death, life's grisly foe,<br />
A fair one's favour in my heart to shrine:<br />
But how can death and life so well agree,<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />That I can ask of
 heaven to end their strife,<br />
And grant them both in pitying love to me?<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />Yet I will ask,
 though both with risks are rife,<br />
Neither shall hinder me, for heaven must be<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="20" height="1" alt="20 pixel" />The arbiter of
 death as well as life.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
See now if I spoke the truth.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
I am utterly distracted.&#160; (<i>The door closes.</i></p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Lest perhaps he should perceive us,<br />
Let us move a little further.<br />
Now advise me how to act,<br />
Since you see the grief that racks me.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Though it savours of presumption<br />
To white hairs like yours, to hazard<br />
Words of council, yet at times<br />
Even a young man may impart them:<br />
Well-proportioned punishment<br />
Grave defects oft counteracteth.<br />
But when carried to extremes,<br />
It but irritates and hardens.<br />
Any instrument of music<br />
Of this truth is an example.<br />
Lightly touched, it breathes but sweetness,<br />
Discord, when 't is roughly handled.<br />
'T is not well to send an arrow<br />
To such heights, that in discharging<br />
The strong tension breaks the bowstring,<br />
Or the bow itself is fractured.<br />
These two simple illustrations<br />
Are sufficiently adapted<br />
To my purpose, of advising<br />
Means of cure both mild and ample.<br />
You must take a middle course,<br />
All extremes must be abandoned.<br />
Gentle but judicious treatment<br />
Is the method for Chrysanthus.<br />
For severer methods end in<br />
Disappointment and disaster.<br />
Take him, then, from out his prison,<br />
Leave him free, unchecked, untrammelled,<br />
For the danger is an infant<br />
Without strength to hurt or harm him.<br />
Be it that those wretched Christians<br />
Have bewitched him, disenchant him,<br />
Since you have the power; for Nature<br />
With such careful forethought acteth,<br />
That an antidotal herb<br />
She for every poison planteth.<br />
And if, finally, your wish<br />
Is that he this fatal sadness<br />
Should forget, and wholly change it<br />
To a happier state and gladder,<br />
Get him married: for remember<br />
Nothing is so well adapted<br />
To restrain discursive fancies<br />
As the care and the attachment<br />
Centered in a wife and children;<br />
Taking care that in this matter<br />
Mere convenience should not weigh<br />
More than his own taste and fancy:<br />
Let him choose his wife himself.<br />
Pleased in that, to rove or ramble<br />
Then will be beyond his power,<br />
Even were he so attracted,<br />
For a happy married lover<br />
Thinks of naught except his rapture.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
I with nothing such good counsel<br />
Can repay, except the frankness<br />
Of accepting it, which is<br />
The reward yourself would ask for.<br />
And since I a mean must choose<br />
Between two extremes of action,<br />
From his cell, to-day, my son<br />
Shall go forth, but in a manner<br />
That will leave his seeming freedom<br />
Circumscribed and safely guarded.<br />
Let that hall which looketh over<br />
Great Apollo's beauteous garden<br />
Be made gay by flowing curtains,<br />
Be festooned by flowery garlands;<br />
Costly robes for him get ready;<br />
Then invite the loveliest damsels<br />
Rome can boast of, to come hither<br />
To the feasts and to the dances.<br />
Bring musicians, and in fine<br />
Let it be proclaimed that any<br />
Woman of illustrious blood<br />
Who from his delusive passions<br />
Can divert him, by her charms<br />
Curing him of all his sadness,<br />
Shall become his wife, how humble<br />
Her estate, her wealth how scanty.<br />
And if this be not sufficient,<br />
I will give a golden talent<br />
Yearly to the leech who cures him<br />
By some happy stroke of practice.&#160; [<i>Exit.</i></p>

And a barber came to draw it.<br />
As he sat with jaws expanded,<br />
"Which tooth is it, sir, that pains you?"<br />
Asked of him the honest barber,<br />
And the patient in affected<br />
Language grandly thus made answer,<br />
"The penultimate"; the dentist<br />
Not being used to such pedantic<br />
Talk as this, with ready forceps<br />
Soon the last of all extracted.<br />
The poor patient to be certain,<br />
With his tongue the spot examined,<br />
And exclaimed, his mouth all bleeding,<br />
"Why, that 's not the right tooth, master".<br />
"Is it not the ultimate molar?"<br />
Said the barber quite as grandly.<br />
"Yes" (he answered), "but I said<br />
The penultimate, and I 'd have you<br />
Know, your worship, that it means<br />
Simply that that 's next the farthest".<br />
Thus instructed, he returned<br />
To the attack once more, remarking<br />
"In effect then the bad tooth<br />
Is the one that 's next the last one?"<br />
"Yes", he said, "then here it is",<br />
Spoke the barber with great smartness,<br />
Plucking out the tooth that then<br />
Was the last but one; it happened<br />
From not speaking plain, he lost<br />
Two good teeth, and kept his bad one.</p>

<img src="indent.gif" width="40" height="1" alt="40 pixel" />Ah! would to Jove
 't were so!<br />
And that my death in his wild hands had paid<br />
For future chastisement by fate delayed!<br />
But ah! the wish is vain,<br />
Foreboding horror fills my heart and brain,<br />
This mystic music borne upon the air<br />
Must surely augur ill.</p>
<p>(<i>Enter</i> <b>Nisida.</b>)</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />Daria fair,<br />
And Cynthia wise, I come to seek ye two.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Has any thing occurred or strange or new?</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
I scarce can tell it.&#160; As I came along,<br />
I heard a man, in a clear voice and strong,<br />
Proclaiming as he went<br />
Through all the mountain a most strange event:<br />
Rome hath decreed<br />
Priceless rewards to her whose charms may lead<br />
Through lawful love and in an open way<br />
By public wedlock in the light of day,<br />
The son of proud Polemius from the state<br />
Of gloom in which his mind is sunk of late.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
And what can be the cause that he is so?</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Ah! that I do not know,<br />
But yonder, leaving the Salarian Way,<br />
A Roman soldier hitherward doth stray:<br />
He may enlighten us and tell us all.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Yes, let us know the truth, the stranger call.</p>
<p><b>Daria</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
Ah! how distinct the pain<br />
That presses on my heart, and dulls my wildered brain!</p>
<p>(<i>Enter Escarpin.</i>)</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Thou, O thou, whose wandering footsteps<br />
These secluded groves have entered . . .<sup><a name="nine" id="nine"></a><a
 href="#nine-note">9</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Thou four hundred times repeated&#8212;<br />
Thou and all the thous, your servant.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Tell us of the proclamation<br />
Publicly to-day presented<br />
To the gaze of Rome.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />I 'll do
 so;<br />
For there 's nothing I love better<br />
Than a story (<i>aside,</i> if to tell it<br />
In divine Daria's presence<br />
Does not put me out, for no one,<br />
When the loved one listens, ever<br />
Speaks his best): Polemius,<br />
Rome's great senator, whose bended<br />
Shoulders, like an Atlas, bear<br />
All the burden of the empire,<br />
By Numerian's self entrusted,<br />
He, this chief of Rome's great senate,<br />
Has a son, by name Chrysanthus,<br />
Who, as rumour goes, at present<br />
Is afflicted by a sadness<br />
So extreme and so excessive,<br />
That 't is thought to be occasioned<br />
By the magic those detested<br />
Christians (who abhor his house,<br />
And his father, who hath pressed them<br />
Heavily as judge and ruler)<br />
Have against his life effected,<br />
All through hatred of our gods.<br />
And so great is the dejection<br />
That he feels, there 's nothing yet<br />
Found to rouse him or divert him.<br />
Thus it is Numerianus,<br />
Who is ever well-affected<br />
To his father, hath proclaimed<br />
All through Rome, that whosoever<br />
Is so happy by her beauty,<br />
Or so fortunately clever<br />
By her wit, or by her graces<br />
Is so powerful, as to temper<br />
His affliction, since love conquers<br />
All things by his magic presence,<br />
He will give her (if a noble)<br />
As his wife, and will present her<br />
With a portion far surpassing<br />
All Polemius' self possesses,<br />
Not to speak of what is promised<br />
Him whose skill may else effect it.<br />
Thus it is that Rome to-day<br />
Laurel wreaths and crowns presenteth<br />
To its most renowned physicians,<br />
To its sages and its elders,<br />
And to wit and grace and beauty<br />
Joyous feasts and courtly revels;<br />
So that there is not a lady<br />
In all Rome, but thinks it certain<br />
That the prize is hers already,<br />
Since by all 't will be contested,<br />
Some through vanity, and some<br />
Through a view more interested:<br />
Even the ugly ones, I warrant,<br />
Will be there well represented.<br />
So with this, adieu.&#160; (<i>Aside,</i> Oh! fairest<br />
Nymph Daria, since I ventured<br />
Here to see thee, having seen thee<br />
Now, alas! I must absent me!)&#160; [<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
What strange news!</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />There 's not a
 beauty<br />
But for victory will endeavour<br />
When among Rome's fairest daughters<br />
Such a prize shall be contested.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Thus by showing us the value<br />
Thou upon the victory settest,<br />
We may understand that thou<br />
Meanest in the lists to enter.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Yes, so far as heaven through music<br />
Its most magic cures effecteth,<br />
Since no witchcraft is so potent<br />
But sweet music may dispel it.<br />
It doth tame the raging wild beast,<br />
Lulls to sleep the poisonous serpent,<br />
And makes evil genii, who<br />
Are revolted spirits&#8212;rebels&#8212;<br />
Fly in fear, and in this art<br />
I have always been most perfect:<br />
Wrongly would I act to-day,<br />
In not striving for the splendid<br />
Prize which will be mine, when I<br />
See myself the loved and wedded<br />
Wife of the great senator's son,<br />
And the mistress of such treasures.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Although music is an art<br />
Which so many arts excelleth,<br />
Still in truth 't is but a sound<br />
Which the wanton air disperses.<br />
It the sweet child of the air<br />
In the air itself must perish.<br />
I, who in my studious reading<br />
Have such learn&#233;d lore collected,<br />
Who in poetry, that art<br />
Which both teacheth and diverteth,<br />
May precedence claim o'er many<br />
Geniuses so prized at present,<br />
Can a surer victory hope for<br />
In the great fight that impendeth,<br />
Since the music of the soul<br />
Is what keeps the mind suspended.<br />
In one item, Nisida,<br />
We two differ: thy incentive<br />
Thy chief motive, is but interest:<br />
Mine is vanity, a determined<br />
Will no other woman shall<br />
Triumph o'er me in this effort,<br />
Since I wish that Rome should see<br />
That the glory, the perfection<br />
Of a woman is her mind,<br />
All her other charms excelling.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Interest and vanity<br />
Are the two things, as you tell me,<br />
That, O Cynthia! can oblige thee,<br />
That, O Nisida, can compel thee<br />
To attempt this undertaking<br />
By so many risks attended.<br />
But I think you both are wrong,<br />
Since in this case, having heard that<br />
The affliction this man suffers<br />
Christian sorcery hath effected<br />
Through abhorrence of our gods,<br />
By that atheist sect detested,<br />
Neither of these feelings should<br />
Be your motive to attempt it.<br />
I then, who, for this time only<br />
Will believe these waves that tell me&#8212;<br />
These bright fountains&#8212;that the beauty<br />
Which so oft they have reflected<br />
Is unequalled, mean to lay it<br />
As an offering in the temple<br />
Of the gods, to show what little<br />
Strength in Christian sorcery dwelleth.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Then 't is openly admitted<br />
That we three the list will enter<br />
For the prize.</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />And from this
 moment<br />
That the rivalry commences.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Voice of song, thy sweet enchantment<br />
On this great occasion lend me,<br />
That through thy soft influence<br />
Rank and riches I may merit.&#160; [<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Genius, offspring of the soul,<br />
Prove this time thou 'rt so descended,<br />
That thy proud ambitious hopes<br />
May the laurel crown be tendered.&#160; [<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />

Is then everything prepared?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Everything has been got ready<br />
As you ordered.&#160; This apartment<br />
Opening on the garden terrace<br />
Has been draped and covered over<br />
With the costliest silks and velvets,<br />
Leaving certain spaces bare<br />
For the painter's magic pencil,<br />
Where, so cunning is his art,<br />
That it nature's self resembles.<br />
Flowers more fair than in the garden,<br />
Pinks and roses are presented:<br />
But what wonder when the fountains<br />
Still run after to reflect them?&#8212;<br />
All things else have been provided,<br />
Music, dances, gala dresses;<br />
And for all that, Rome yet knows not<br />
What in truth is here projected;<br />
'T is a fair Academy,<br />
In whose floral halls assemble<br />
Beauty, wit, and grace, a sight<br />
That we see but very seldom.<br />
All the ladies too of Rome<br />
Have prepared for the contention<br />
With due circumspection, since<br />
As his wife will be selected<br />
She who best doth please him; thus<br />
There are none but will present them<br />
In these gardens, some to see him,<br />
Others to show off themselves here.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Oh, my Claudius, would to Jove<br />
That all this could dispossess me<br />
Of my dark foreboding fancies,<br />
Of the terrors that oppress me!&#8212;</p>
<p>(<i>Enter Aurelius.</i>)</p>
<p><b>Aurelius.</b><br />
Sir, a very learned physician<br />
Comes to proffer his best service<br />
To Chrysanthus, led by rumour<br />
Of his illness.</p>

<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />Bid him
 enter.<br />
[<i>Aurelius retires, and returns immediately with Carpophorus, disguised as a

<p><b>Carpophorus</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
Heaven, that I may do the work<br />
That this day I have attempted,<br />
Grant me strength a little while;<br />
For I know my death impendeth!&#8212;<br />
Mighty lord, thy victor hand, [<i>aloud.</i><br />

Thou alone canst save my son.</p>

From my home.&#160; Inform me then<br />
How Chrysanthus is affected.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
With an overwhelming sadness;<br />
Or to speak it more correctly<br />
(Since when we consult a doctor<br />
Even suspicions should be mentioned),<br />
He, my son, has been bewitched;&#8212;<br />

He by music is attended.<br />
(<i>Enter Chrysanthus richly dressed, preceded by musicians playing and singing,
 and followed by attendants.</i>)</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Cease; my pain, perchance my folly,<br />
Cannot be by song diverted;<br />
Music is a power exerted<br />
For the cure of melancholy,<br />
Which in truth it but augmenteth.</p>
<p><b>A Musician.</b><br />
This your father bade us do.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
'T is because he never knew<br />
Pain like that which me tormenteth.<br />
For if he that pang incessant<br />
Felt, he would not wish to cure it,<br />
He would love it and endure it.</p>

Think, my son, that I am present,<br />
And that I am not ambitious<br />
To assume your evil mood,<br />
But to find that it is good.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
No, sir, you mistake my wishes.<br />
I would not through you relieve me<br />
Of my care; my former state<br />
Seemed, though, more to mitigate<br />
What I suffer: why not leave me<br />
There to die?</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />

Who do I behold? ah, me!</p>

I will speak to him with your leave.</p>

No, my eyes do not deceive,<br />
'T is Carpophorus that I see!<br />
I my pleasure must conceal.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
Sir, of what do you complain?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Since you come to cure my pain,<br />
I will tell you how I feel.<br />
A great sadness hath been thrown<br />
O'er my mind and o'er my feelings,<br />
A dark blank whose dim revealings<br />
Make their sombre tints mine own.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
Can you any cause assign me<br />
Whence this sadness is proceeding?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
From my earliest years to reading<br />
Did my studious tastes incline me.<br />
Something thus acquired doth wake<br />
Doubts, and fears, and hopes, ah me!<br />
That the things I read may be.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus.</b><br />
Then from me this lesson take.<br />
Every mystery how obscure,<br />
Is explained by faith alone;<br />
All is clear when that is known:<br />
'T is through faith I 'll work your cure.<br />
Since in that your healing lies,<br />
Take it then from me.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="120" height="1" alt="120 pixel" />From you<br />
I infer all good: that true<br />
Faith I hope which you advise.</p>
<p><b>Carpophorus</b> (<i>to Polemius</i>).<br />
Give me leave, sir, to address<br />
Some few words to him alone,<br />
Less reserve will then be shown.&#160; (<i>The two retire to one side.</i><br />
Have you recognized me?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />Yes,<br />
Every sign shows you are he<br />
Who in my most perilous strait<br />
Fled and left me to my fate.</p>

God did that; and would you see<br />
That it was His own work, say,<br />
If I did not then absent me<br />
Through His means, could I present me<br />
As your teacher here to-day?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
No.</p>

 providence!<br />
Since I was preserved, that I<br />
Here might seek you, and more nigh<br />
Give you full intelligence<br />
Leisurely of every doubt<br />
Which disturbs you when you read.</p>

Mysteries they are indeed,<br />
Difficult to be made out.</p>

Your intellectual pride subdue.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
I will subdue it, since 't is vain.</p>

Then the first thing to be done<br />
Is to be baptized.</p>

Father, and implore it now.</p>

Further notice; lest suspicion<br />
Should betray what we would smother;<br />
Every day we 'll see each other,<br />
When I 'll execute my mission:<br />

Will at fitting time baptize you,<br />
Taking care to catechise you<br />
In the principles of the faith;<br />
Only now one admonition<br />
Must I give; be armed, be ready<br />
For the fight most fierce and steady<br />
Ever fought for man's perdition;<br />
Oh! take heed, amid the advances<br />
Of the fair who wish to win you,<br />
'Mid the fires that burn within you,<br />
'Mid lascivious looks and glances,<br />
'Mid such various foes enlisted,<br />
That you are not conquered by them.</p>

I will give you ample wealth,<br />
If you can restore his health.</p>

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Why?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="60" height="1" alt="60 pixel" />A tale in point
 I 'll tell:<br />
Once a snuffler, by a pirate<br />
Moor was captured, who in some<br />
Way affected to be dumb,<br />
That his ransom at no high rate<br />
Might be purchased: when his owner<br />
This defect perceived, the shuffle<br />
Made him sell this Mr. Snuffle<br />
Very cheaply: to the donor<br />
Of his freedom, through his nose,<br />
Half in snuffle, half in squeak,<br />
Then he said, "Oh! Moor, I speak,<br />
I 'm not dumb as you suppose".<br />
"Fool, to let your folly lead you<br />
So astray", replied the Moor.<br />
"Had I heard you <i>speak,</i> be sure<br />
I <i>for nothing</i> would have freed you".<br />
Thus it is I moderate me<br />
In the use of tongue and cheek,<br />
Lest when you have heard me speak,<br />
Still more cheaply you may rate me.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
You must know the estimation<br />
I have held you in so long.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Well, my memory is not strong.<br />
It requires <i>consideration</i><br />
To admit that pleasant fact.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
What of me do people say?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Shall I speak it?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="100" height="1" alt="100 pixel" />Speak.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />Why, they<br />
Say, my lord, that you are cracked.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
For what reason?&#160; Why this blame?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Reason, sir, need not be had,<br />
For the wisest man is mad<br />
If he only gets the name.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Well, it was not wrongly given,<br />
If they only knew that I<br />
Have consented even to die<br />
So to reach the wished-for heaven<br />
Of a sovereign beauty's favour.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
For a lady's favour you<br />
Have agreed to die?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />'T is true.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Does not this a certain savour<br />
Of insanity give your sadness?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Were I certain as of breath<br />
I could claim it after death,<br />
There was method in my madness.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
A brave soldier of the line,<br />
On his death-bed lying ill,<br />
Spoke thus, "Item, 't is my will,<br />
Gallant friends and comrades mine,<br />
That you 'll bear me to my grave,<br />
And although I 've little wealth,<br />
Thirty reals to drink my health<br />
Shall you for your kindness have".<br />
Thus the hope as vain must be<br />
After death one's love to wed,<br />
As to drink one's health when dead.<br />
[<i>Nisida advances from the garden.</i>]</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
But what maid is this I see<br />
Hither through the garden wending?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
If you take a stroll with me<br />
Plenty of her sort you 'll see.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
One who would effect the ending<br />
Of thy sadness.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="80" height="1" alt="80 pixel" />Now comes near
 thee,<br />
O my heart, thy threatened trial!<br />
Lady, pardon the denial,<br />
But I would nor see nor hear thee.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Not so ungallantly surely<br />
Wilt thou act, as not to see<br />
One who comes to speak with thee?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
To see one who thinks so poorly<br />
Of herself, and with such lightness<br />
Owns she comes to speak with me,<br />
Rather would appear to be<br />
Want of sense than of politeness.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
All discourse is not so slight<br />
That thou need'st decline it so.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
No, I will not see thee, no.<br />
Thus I shut thee from my sight.</p>
<p><b>Nisida.</b><br />
Vainly art thou cold and wise,<br />
Other senses thou shouldst fear,<br />
Since I enter by the ear,<br />
Though thou shut me from the eyes.</p>
<p><i>Sings.<br />
"The bless&#233;d rapture of forgetting<br />
Never doth my heart deserve,<br />

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
That melting voice, that melody<br />
Spell-bound holds th' entranc&#233;d soul.<br />
Ah! from such divine control<br />
Who his fettered soul could free?&#8212;<br />
Human Siren, leave me, go!<br />
Too well I feel its fatal power.<br />
I faint before it like a flower<br />
By warm-winds wooed in noontide's glow.<br />
The close-pressed lips the mouth can lock,<br />
And so repress the vain reply,<br />
The lid can veil th' unwilling eye<br />
From all that may offend and shock,&#8212;<br />
Nature doth seem a niggard here,<br />
Unequally her gifts disposing,<br />
For no instinctive means of closing<br />
She gives the unprotected ear.</p>
<p>(<i>Enter Cynthia.</i>)</p>
<p><b>Cynthia.</b><br />
Since then the ear cannot be closed,<br />
And thou resistance need'st not try,<br />
Listen to the gloss that I<br />
On this sweet conceit composed:<br />
"The bless&#233;d rapture of forgetting<br />
Never doth my heart deserve;<br />
What my memory would preserve<br />
Is the memory I 'm regretting".<br />
When Nature from the void obscure<br />
Her varied world to life awakes,<br />
All things find use and so endure:&#8212;<br />
Thus she a poison never makes<br />
Without its corresponding cure:<br />
Each thing of Nature's careful setting,<br />
Each plant that grows in field or grove<br />
Hath got its opposite flower or weed;<br />
The cure is with the pain decreed;<br />
Thus too is found for feverish love<br />
<i>The bless&#233;d rapture of forgetting.</i><br />
The starry wonders of the night,<br />
The arbiters of fate on high,<br />
Nothing can dim:&#160; To see their light<br />
Is easy, but to draw more nigh<br />
The orbs themselves, exceeds our might.<br />
Thus 't is to know, and only know,<br />
The troubled heart, the trembling nerve,<br />
To sweet oblivion's blank may owe<br />
Their rest, but, ah! <i>that</i> cure of woe<br />
<i>Never doth my heart deserve.</i><br />
Then what imports it that there be,<br />
For all the ills of heart or brain,<br />
A sweet oblivious remedy,<br />
If it, when 't is applied to me,<br />
Fails to cure me of my pain?<br />
Forgetfulness in me doth serve<br />
No useful purpose: But why fret<br />
My heart at this?&#160; Do I deserve,<br />
Strange contradiction! to forget<br />
<i>What my memory would preserve?</i><br />
And thus my pain in straits like these,<br />
Must needs despise the only sure<br />
Remedial means of partial ease&#8212;<br />
That is&#8212;to perish of the cure<br />
Rather than die of the disease.<br />
Then not in wailing or in fretting,<br />
My love, accept thy fate, but let<br />
This victory o'er myself, to thee<br />
Bring consolation, pride, and glee,<br />
Since what I wish not to forget<br />
<i>Is the memory I 'm regretting.</i></p>

Icy torpor coldly fastens<br />
On my hands; the lute drops from me,<br />

To this subtle play of fancy:<br />

I am changed to living marble.</p>

Being poets and musicians,<br />
Quite accounts, sir, for their absence.</p>

'Gainst all sorceries whatsoever,<br />

Art thou then Chrysanthus?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />Yes.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Not confused or troubled, rather<br />
With a certain fear I see thee,<br />
For which I have grounds most ample.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Why?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="40" height="1" alt="40 pixel" />Because I thought
 thou wert<br />
One who in a darksome cavern<br />
Died to show thy love for me.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
I have yet been not so happy<br />
As to have a chance, Daria,<br />
Of thus proving my attachment.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Be that so, I 've come to seek thee,<br />
Confident, completely sanguine,<br />
That I have the power to conquer,<br />
I alone, thy pains, thy anguish;<br />
Though against me thou shouldst use<br />
The Christian armoury&#8212;enchantments.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
That thou hast alone the power<br />
To subdue the pains that wrack me,<br />
I admit it; but in what<br />
Thou hast said of Christian magic<br />
I, Daria, must deny it.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
How? from what cause else could happen<br />
The effects I just have witnessed?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Miracles they are and marvels.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Why do they affect not me?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
'T is because I do not ask them<br />
Against thee; because from aiding<br />
Not myself, no aid is granted.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Then I come here to undo them.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Most severe will be the battle,<br />
Upon one side their due praises<br />
On the other side thy anger.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
I would have thee understand<br />
That our gods are sorely damaged<br />
By thy sentiments.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="180" height="1" alt="180 pixel" />And I<br />
That those gods are false&#8212;mere phantoms.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Then get ready for the conflict,<br />
For I will not lower my standard<br />
Save with victory or death.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Though thou makest me thy captive,<br />
Thou my firmness wilt not conquer.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Then to arms! I say, to arms, then!</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Though the outposts of the soul,<br />
The weak heart, by thee be captured;<br />
Not so will the Understanding,<br />
The strong warden who doth guard it.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Thou 'lt believe me, if thou 'lt love me.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Thou not me, 'till love attracts thee.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
That perhaps may be; for I<br />
Would not give thee this advantage.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Oh! that love indeed may lead thee<br />
To a state so sweet and happy!</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Oh! what power will disabuse thee<br />
Of thy ignorance, Chrysanthus?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Oh! what pitying power, Daria,<br />
Will the Christian faith impart thee?</p>

<p><b>Scene I.</b>&#8212;<i>The Garden of Polemius.</i></p>
</center>
<p><i>Enter</i> <b>Polemius, Aurelius, Claudius,</b> <i>and</i>
 <b>Escarpin.</b></p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
All my house is in confusion,<br />
Full of terrors, full of horrors;<sup><a name="eleven" id="eleven"></a><a
 href="#eleven-note">11</a></sup><br />
Ah! how true it is a son<br />
Is the source of many sorrows!&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
But, my lord, reflect . . .</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />Consider
 . . .<br />
Think . . .</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="40" height="1" alt="40 pixel" />Why think, when
 misery follows?&#8212;<br />
Cease: you add to my affliction,<br />
And in no way bring me solace.<br />
Since you see that in his madness<br />
He is now more firm and constant,<br />
Falling sick of new diseases,<br />
Ere he 's well of old disorders:<br />
Since one young and beauteous maiden,<br />
Whom love wished to him to proffer,<br />
Free from every spot and blemish,<br />
Pure and perfect in her fondness,<br />
Is the one whose fatal charms<br />
Give to him such grief and torment,<br />
That each moment he may perish,<br />
That he may expire each moment;<br />
How then can you hope that I<br />
Now shall list to words of comfort?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Why not give this beauteous maiden<br />
To your son to be his consort,<br />
Since you see his inclination?</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
For this reason: when the project<br />
I proposed, the two made answer,<br />
That before they wed, some problem,<br />
Some dispute that lay between them<br />
Should be settled: this seemed proper:<br />
But when I would know its nature<br />
I could not the cause discover.<br />
From this closeness I infer<br />
That some secret of importance<br />
Lies between them, and that this<br />
Is the source of all my sorrows.</p>
<p><b>Aurelius.</b><br />
Sir, my loyalty, my duty<br />
Will not let me any longer<br />
Silence keep, too clearly seeing<br />
How the evil has passed onward.<br />
On that day we searched the mountain. . . .</p>
<p><b>Polemius</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
Woe is me! could he have known then<br />
All this time it was Chrysanthus?</p>
<p><b>Aurelius.</b><br />
I approaching, where with shoulders<br />
Turned against me stood one figure,<br />
Saw the countenance of another,<br />
And methinks he was . . .</p>
<p><b>Polemius</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="160" height="1" alt="160 pixel" />Ye gods!<br />
Yes, he saw him! help! support me!</p>
<p><b>Aurelius.</b><br />
The same person who came hither<br />
Lately in the garb of a doctor,<br />
Who to-day to cure Chrysanthus<br />
Such unusual treatment orders.<br />
Do you ascertain if he<br />
Is Carpophorus; let no portent<br />
Fright you, on yourself rely,<br />
And you 'll find that all will prosper.</p>
<p><b>Polemius.</b><br />
Thanks, Aurelius, for your warning,<br />
Though 't is somewhat tardily offered.<br />
Whether you are right or wrong,<br />
I to-day will solve the problem.<br />
For the sudden palpitation<br />
Of my heart that beats and throbbeth<br />
'Gainst my breast, doth prove how true<br />
Are the suspicions that it fostered.<br />
And if so, then Rome will see<br />
Such examples made, such torments,<br />
That one bleeding corse will show<br />
Wounds enough for myriad corses.&#160; [<i>Exeunt Aurelius and Polemius.</i></p>

Hither came, and who (strange portent!)<br />
Had some share of his bewitchment<br />
In the stupor that came on them?</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Yes, sir, and what 's worse, Daria<br />
Was another, thus the torment<br />
That we both endure is equal,<br />
If my case be not the stronger,<br />
Since to love her would be almost<br />
Less an injury than to scorn her.</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Well, I will not quarrel with you<br />
On the point (for it were nonsense)<br />
Whether one should feel more keenly<br />
Love or hate, disdain or fondness<br />
Shown to one we love; enough<br />
'T is to me to know, that prompted<br />
Or by vanity or by interest,<br />
She came hither to hold converse<br />
With him, 't is enough to make me<br />
Lose the love I once felt for her.</p>

A new story?</p>

 stories,<br />
Sir, is not my <i>forte,</i> 'pon honour:&#8212;<br />
Though who would n't make a hazard<br />
When the ball is over the pocket?&#8212;</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
Well, I do not care to hear it.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Ah, you know it then: Another<br />
Let me try: A friar once . . .<br />
Stay though, I have quite forgotten<br />
There are no friars yet in Rome:<br />
Well, once more: a fool . . .</p>
<p><b>Claudius.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="140" height="1" alt="140 pixel" />A blockhead<br />
Like yourself, say: cease.</p>

My poor tale do n't cruelly shorten.<br />
While the sacristan was blowing . . .</p>

Why, by heaven! I 'll kill you, donkey.</p>
<p><b>Escarpin.</b><br />
Hear me first, and kill me after.</p>

O ye gods, since my intention<br />
Was in empty air to scatter<br />
All these prodigies and wonders<br />
Worked in favour of Chrysanthus<br />
By the Christians' sorcery, why,<br />
Having you for my copartners,<br />
Do I not achieve a victory<br />
Which my beauty might make facile?</p>

Was to melt Daria's hardness,<br />
And to bring her to the knowledge<br />

He is here, and though already<br />
Even to see him, to have parley<br />
With him, lights a living fire<br />
In my breast, which burns yet glads me,<br />
Yet he must confess my gods,<br />
Ere I own that I am vanquished.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
She comes hither, and though I<br />
By her beauty am distracted,<br />
Still she must become a Christian<br />

To come near him makes me tremble.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus</b> (<i>aside</i>).<br />
To address her, quite unmans me:&#8212;<br />
Not in vain, O fair Daria, (<i>aloud.</i><br />
Does the verdure of this garden,<br />
When it sees thee pass, grow young<br />
As beneath spring's dewy spangles;<br />
Not in vain, since though 't is evening,<br />
Thou a new Aurora dazzleth,<br />
That the birds in public concert<br />
Hail thee with a joyous anthem;<br />
Not in vain the streams and fountains,<br />
As their crystal current passes,<br />
Keep melodious time and tune<br />
With the bent boughs of the alders;<br />
The light movement of the zephyrs<br />
As athwart the flowers they 're wafted,<br />
Bends their heads to see thee coming,<br />
Then uplifts them to look after.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
These fine flatteries, these fine phrases<br />
Make me doubt of thee, Chrysanthus.<br />
He who gilds the false so well,<br />
Must mere truth find unattractive.</p>

Hast thou then such little faith<br />
In my love?</p>

 marvel.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Why?</p>

Doth a love deserve that acteth<br />
Such deceptions.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />

 deceptions?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Are not those enough, Chrysanthus,<br />
That thou usest to convince me<br />
Of thy love, of thy attachment,<br />
When my first and well-known wishes<br />
Thou perversely disregardest?<br />
Is it possible a man<br />
So distinguished for his talents,<br />
So illustrious in his blood,<br />
Such a favourite from his manners,<br />
Would desire to ruin all<br />
By an error so unhappy,<br />
And for some delusive dream<br />
See himself abhorred and branded?</p>

I nor talents, manners, blood,<br />
Would be worthy of, if madly<br />
I denied a Great First Cause,<br />

Sun, moon, stars, fish, birds, beasts, <i>Man</i> then.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Did not Jupiter, then, make heaven,<br />
Where we hear his thunders rattle?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
No, for if he could have made<br />
Heaven, he had no need to grasp it<br />
For himself at the partition,<br />
When to Neptune's rule he granted<br />

Tell me, is not Saturn time?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
He is not, though he dispatcheth<br />

Is not Venus the air?</p>

Gods adulterers and assassins!<br />
Gods who pride themselves for thefts,<br />
And a thousand forms of badness,<br />
If the ideas God and Sin<br />
Are opposed as light to darkness?&#8212;<br />
With another argument<br />
I would further sift the matter.<br />
Let then Jupiter be a god,<br />

Let Apollo be one also:<br />
Should Jove wish to hurl in anger<br />
Down his red bolts on the world,<br />
And Apollo would not grant them,<br />

From the independent action<br />
Of the two does it not follow<br />

Then they cannot be called gods,<br />

When you helped yourself, and prayed for<br />
Its assistance: were you not guarded<br />
By it when a sweet voice sung,<br />
When a keen wit glowed and argued,<br />
When the instrument was silenced,<br />
When the tongue was forced to stammer,<br />
Until now, when with free will<br />
You succumb to the enchantment<br />

It is not to speak with thee.</p>

Thou hast said a God once died<br />
Through His boundless love to me:<br />

Let me this one strong point try . . .</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
What?</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
<img src="indent.gif" width="60" height="1" alt="60 pixel" />To be a God, and

Doth imply a contradiction.<br />
And if thou dost still deny<br />
To my god the name divine,<br />
And reject him in thy scorn<br />
For beginning, I opine,<br />
If thy God could die, that mine<br />
Might as easily be born.</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
Thou dost argue with great skill,<br />
But thou must remember still,<br />
That He hath, this God of mine,<br />
Human nature and divine,<br />
And that it has been His will<br />
As it were His power to hide&#8212;<br />
God made man&#8212;man deified&#8212;<br />
When this sinful world He trod,<br />
Since He was not born as God,<br />
And it was as man He died.</p>
<p><b>Daria.</b><br />
Does it not more greatness prove,<br />
As among the beauteous stars,<br />
That one deity should be Mars,<br />
And another should be Jove,<br />
Than this blending God above<br />
With weak man below?&#160; To thee<br />
Does not the twin deity<br />
Of two gods more power display,<br />
Than if in some mystic way<br />
God and man conjoined could be?</p>
<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />
No, I would infer this rather,<br />
If the god-head were not one,<br />
Each a separate course could run:<br />
But the untreated Father,<br />
But the sole-begotten Son,<br />
But the Holy Spirit who<br />
Ever issues from the two,<br />
Being one sole God, must be<br />
One in power and dignity:&#8212;<br />
Until <i>thou</i> dost hold this true,<br />
Till thy creed is that the Son<br />
Was made man, I cannot hear thee,<br />
Cannot see thee or come near thee,<br />
Thee and death at once to shun.</p>

All that I could have replied<br />
Has been said thus suddenly<br />
By this voice that, sounding near,<br />
Strikes upon my startled ear<br />
Like the summons of my death.</p>

<p><b>Chrysanthus.</b><br />

In the midnight's dusky robe,<br />
As the light amid the darkness,<br />
As 'mid clouds the solar globe:<br />
But although the shades and shadows,<br />
Through the vapours of Heaven's dome.<br />
Strive with villainous presumption<br />
Light and splendour to enfold,<br />
Though they may conceal the lustre,<br />
Still they cannot stain it, no.<br />
And it is a consolation<br />
This to know, that even the gold,<br />

Who can spend a little gold;<br />
And since happily love's tariff<br />
Is not an excessive toll,<br />
Here I am, and so, Daria,<br />

I command thee to release him,<br />
Free this man and let him go.</p>

None, if they are wise I trow.<br />
With her hand upon his mane,<br />
Quite familiarly they go<br />
Through the centre of the city.<br />
Crowds give way as they approach,<br />
And as he who looketh on<br />
Knoweth of the game much more<br />
Than the players, I perceive<br />
They the open country seek<br />
On the further side of Rome.<br />
Like a husband and a wife,<br />
In the pleasant sunshine's glow,<br />
Taking the sweet air they seem.<br />
Well the whole affair doth show<br />
So much curious contradiction,<br />
That, my thought, a brief discourse<br />
You and I must have together.<br />
Is the God whose name is known<br />
To Daria, the same God<br />
Whom Carpophorus adored?<br />
Why, from this what inference follows?<br />
Only this, if it be so,<br />
That Daria He defends,<br />
But the poor Carpophorus, no.<br />
And as I am much more likely<br />
His sad fate to undergo,<br />
Than to be like her protected,<br />
I to change my faith am loth.<br />
So part pagan and part christian<br />

<p><sup>4</sup> The resemblance between certain parts of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>
 and <i>The Wonder-Working
Magician</i> of Calderon has been frequently alluded to, and has given
rise to a good deal of discussion.&#160; In the controversy as to how much the
German poet was indebted to the Spanish, I do not recollect any reference to
 <i>The
Two Lovers of Heaven.</i>&#160; The following passage, however, both in its
 spirit
and language, presents a singular likeness to the more elaborate discussion of
the same difficulty in the text.&#160; The scene is in Faustus's study.&#160;
 Faustus, as
in the present play, takes up a volume of the New Testament, and thus
proceeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>"In the beginning was the Word".</b>&#160; Alas!<br />
The first line stops me: how shall I proceed?<br />
"The word" cannot express the meaning here.<br />
I must translate the passage differently,<br />
If by the spirit I am rightly guided.<br />
Once more,&#8212;<b>"In the beginning was the Thought".</b>&#8212;<br />
Consider the first line attentively,<br />
Lest hurrying on too fast, you lose the meaning.<br />
Was it then <i>Thought</i> that has created all things?<br />
Can thought make matter?&#160; Let us try the line<br />
Once more,&#8212;<b>"In the beginning was the Power"</b>&#8212;<br />
This will not do&#8212;even while I write the phrase,<br />
I feel its faults&#8212;oh! help me, holy Spirit,<br />
I 'll weigh the passage once again, and write<br />
Boldly,&#8212;<b>"In the beginning was the Act".</b><br />

<h4>From Ticknor's <i>History of Spanish Literature.</i>&#160; London:
 1863.</h4>
</center>
<p>"Denis Florence M'Carthy published
in London (in 1861) translations of
two plays, and an <i>auto</i> of Calderon,
under the title of 'Love, the greatest
Enchantment; the Sorceries of Sin;
the Devotion of the Cross, from the
Spanish of Calderon, attempted strictly
in English Asonante, and other imitative
Verse', printing, at the same time,
a carefully corrected text of the originals,
page by page, opposite to his
translations.&#160; It is, I think, one of
the boldest attempts ever made in English
verse.&#160; It is, too, as it seems to me, remarkably
successful.&#160; Not that <i>asonantes</i>
can be made fluent or graceful in
English, or easily perceptible to an
English ear, but that the Spanish air
and character of Calderon are so happily
preserved.&#160; Mr. M'Carthy, in
1853, had published two volumes of
translations from Calderon, to which I
have already referred; and, besides
this, he has rendered excellent service
to the cause of Spanish literature in
other ways.&#160; But in the present volume
he has far surpassed all he had previously
done; for Calderon is a poet
who, whenever he is translated, should
have his very excesses, both in thought
and manner, fully produced, in order
to give a faithful idea of what is
grandest and most distinctive in his
genius.&#160; Mr. M'Carthy has done this,
I conceive, to a degree which I had
previously considered impossible.&#160; Nothing,
I think, in the English language
will give us so true an impression of
what is most characteristic of the Spanish
drama; perhaps I ought to say, of
what is most characteristic of Spanish
poetry generally".&#8212;tom. iii. pp. 461,

<p>"I thank you very much for your

and presents the old Spanish dramatist
before the English reader in a very

<p>"Your previous volumes I have long

complete as a single life will permit.&#160;
It seems rather appalling to undertake
the whole of so voluminous a writer.&#160;

<p>"In this point of view, your volume
seems to me little less than marvellous.&#160;
If I had not read it&#8212;indeed, if I had
not carefully gone through with the
<i>Devocion de la Cruz,</i> I should not
have believed it possible to do what you
have done.&#160; Titian, they say, and some
others of the old masters, laid on
colours for their groundwork wholly
different from those they used afterwards,
but which they counted upon to
shine through, and contribute materially
to the grand results they produced.&#160;
So in your translations, the
Spanish seems to come through to the
surface; the original air is always perceptible
in your variations.&#160; It is like
a family likeness coming out in the
next generation, yet with the freshness
of originality.</p>
<p>"But the rhyme is as remarkable as
the verse and the translation; not that
you have made the asonante as perceptible
to the English ear as it is to the
Spanish; our cumbersome consonants
make that impossible.&#160; But the wonder
is, that you have made it perceptible at
all.&#160; I think I perceive your asonantes
much as I do those of August Schlegel
or Gries, and more than I do those of
Friederich Schlegel.&#160; But he was the
first who tried them, and, besides, I am
not a German.&#160; Would it not be amusing

you are always as successful as you

<p>"I cannot resist the impulse I have
of offering you my most grateful thanks
for the greatest intellectual treat I
have ever experienced in my life, and
which you have afforded me in the
magnificent translations of the divine
Calderon; for, surely, of all the poets
the world ever saw, he alone is worthy
of standing beside the author of the
Book of Job and of the Psalms, and
entrusted, like them, with the noble
mission of commending to the hearts
of others all that belongs to the beautiful
and true, ever directing the
thoughtful reader through the love of
the beautiful veil, to the great Author
of all perfection.</p>
<p>"I cannot conceive a nation can
receive a greater boon than being helped
to a love of such works as the religious
dramas of this Prince of Poets.&#160; I have
for years felt this, and as your translations
appeared, have read them with
the greatest possible interest.&#160; I knew
not of the publication of the last, and
it was to an accidental, yet, with me,
habitual outburst of praise of Calderon,
as the antidote and cure for the
trifling literature of the day, that my
friend (<i>the</i>) D&#8212;&#8212; made me aware of its
being out".</p>

<h4><i>From an eloquent article in the "Boston
Courier", March 18, 1862, written by
George Stillman Hillard, Esq., the
author of "Six Months in Italy"&#8212;a
delightful book, worthy of the beautiful
country it so beautifully describes.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"Calderon is one of the three greatest
names in Spanish literature, Lope de
Vega and Cervantes being the other
two.&#160; He is also a great name in the
universal realm of letters, though out
of Spain he is little more than a great
name, except in Germany, that land so
hospitable to famous wits, and where,
to readers and critics of a mystical and
transcendental turn, his peculiar genius
strongly commended him.&#160; To form a
notion of what manner of man Calderon
was, we must imagine a writer
hardly inferior to Shakespeare in fertility
of invention and dramatic insight,
inspired by a religious fervour like that
of Doune or Crashaw, and endowed
with the wild and ethereal imagination
of Shelley.&#160; But the religious fervour
is Catholic, not Protestant, Southern,
not Northern: it is intense, mystical,
and ecstatic: like a tongue of
upward-darting flame, it burns and trembles
with impassioned impulse to mingle
with empyrean fire.&#160; The imagination,
too, is not merely southern, but with an
oriental element shining through it,
like the ruddy heart of an opal". . .</p>
<p>"But our purpose is not to speak of
Calderon, but of his translator Mr.
MacCarthy; and to make our readers
acquainted with his very successful
effort to reproduce in English some of
the most characteristic productions of
the genius of Spain, retaining even one
of the peculiarities in the structure of
the verse which has hardly ever been
transplanted from the soil of the
peninsula". . . .</p>
<p>"Mr. MacCarthy's translations strike
us as among the most successful experiments
which have been made to represent
in our language the characteristic
beauties of the finest productions of
other nations.&#160; They are sufficiently
faithful, as may be readily seen by the
Spanish scholar, as the translator has
the courage to print the original and
his version side by side.&#160; The rich,
imaginative passages of Calderon are
reproduced in language of such grace
and flexibility as shows in Mr. MacCarthy
no inconsiderable amount of
poetical power.&#160; The measures of Calderon
are retained; the rhymed passages
are translated into rhyme, and
what is more noticeable still, Mr. MacCarthy
has done what no writer in English
has ever before essayed, except to
a very limited extent&#8212;he has copied
the <i>asonantes</i> of the original". . . .</p>
<p>"We take leave of Mr. MacCarthy
with hearty acknowledgments for the
pleasure we have had in reading his
excellent translations, which have given
us a sense of Calderon's various and
brilliant genius such as we never before
had, and no analysis of his dramas,
however full and careful, could
bestow".</p>

Tablet", July 19, 1862, written by the

</center>
<p>"This beautiful volume before us&#8212;like
virtue's self, fair within and without&#8212;is
Mr. Mac-Carthy's second contribution
to the Herculean task which
Longfellow cheers him on to continue&#8212;the
translation into English of the
complete works of Calderon.&#160; Two
experimental volumes, containing six
dramas of the same author, appeared
in 1853, winning the well-merited
encomium of every person of true taste
into whose hands they happened to
fall.&#160; The Translator was encouraged,
if not by the general chorus of popular
applause, by the precious and emphatic
approbation of those best entitled by
knowledge and accomplishments to
pronounce judgment.&#160; So here, after
an interval of seven years, we have
right worthily presented to us three of
those famous <i>Autos,</i> which for two
centuries drew together all the multitude
of the Madrilenos, on the annual
return of the great feast of Corpus
Christi.&#160; On that same self-same festival,
in a northern land, under a gray
and clouded sky, in the heart of a city
most unlike gay, garden-hued, out-of-door
Madrid, we have spent the long
hours over these resurrected dramas,
and the spell of both the poets is still
upon us, as we unite together, in dutiful
juxtaposition, the names of Calderon
and Mac-Carthy.</p>
<p>"How richly gifted was this Spanish
priest-poet! this pious playwright! this
moral mechanist! this devout dramatist!&#160;
How rare his experience! how
broad the contrasts of his career, and
of his observation. . . . .&#160; Happy
poet! blessed with such fecundity!&#160;
Happy Christian! blessed with such
fidelity to the divine teachings of the
Cross. . . .</p>
<p>"Very highly do we reverence Calderon,
and very highly value his translator;
yet, if it be not presumptuous to
say so, we venture to suggest that
Mac-Carthy might find nearer home
another work still worthier of his genius
than these translations.&#160; Now that
he has got the imperial ear by bringing
his costly wares from afar, are there
not laurels to be gathered as well in
Ireland as in Spain?&#160; The author of
'The Bell-Founder', of 'St. Brendan's
Voyage', of 'The Foray of Con O'Donnell',
and 'The Pillar Towers', needs
no prompting to discern what abundant
materials for a new department of English
poetry are to be found almost
unused on Irish ground.&#160; May we not
hope that in that field or forest he may
find his appointed work, adding to the
glory of first worthily introducing
Calderon to the English readers of
this century, the still higher glory of
doing for the neglected history of his
fatherland what he has chivalrously
done for the illustrious Spaniard".</p>

<h3>THE PURGATORY OF SAINT PATRICK.</h3>
</center>
<p>"With the 'Purgatory of St. Patrick'
especial pains seem to have been
taken".</p>
<p>"Considerable license has been taken
with the prayer of St. Patrick; but its
spirit is well preserved, and the translator's
poetry must be admired".</p>
<p>"If Calderon can ever be made
popular here, it must be in the manner
generally adopted by Mr. Mac-Carthy
in the specimens, six in number, which
are here translated, preserving, namely,
the metrical form, which is one of the
characteristics of the old Spanish
drama.&#160; This medium, through which
it partakes of the lyrical character, is
no accident of style, but an essential
property of that remarkable creation
of a poetic age&#8212;remarkable, because
while the drama so adorned was entirely
the offspring of popular impulse,
in opposition to many rigorous attempts
in favour of classical methods, it was
at the same time raised above the tone
of common expression by the rhythmical
mode which it assumed, in a
manner decisive of its ideal tendency.&#160;
It thus displays a combination rare in
this kind of poetry: the spirit of an
untutored will, embodied in a form the
romantic expression of which might
seem only congenial to choice and
delicate fancies. . . . .</p>
<p>"In conclusion, what has now been
said of Calderon, and of the stage
which he adorned, as well as of the
praise justly due to parts of Mr. Mac-Carthy's
version, will at least serve to
commend these volumes to curious
lovers of poetry".</p>

<h3>THE CONSTANT PRINCE.</h3>

<p>"In his dramas of a serious and devout
character, in virtue of their dignified
pathos, tragic sublimity, and religious
fervour, Calderon's best title to
praise will be found.&#160; In such, above
all in his <i>Autos,</i> he reached a height
beyond any of his predecessors, whose
productions, on religious themes especially,
striking as many of them are,
with situations and motives of the
deepest effect, are not sustained at the
same impressive elevation, nor disposed
with that consummate judgment which
leaves nothing imperfect or superfluous
in the dramas of Calderon.&#160; 'The Constant
Prince' and 'The Physician of
his own Honour', which Mr. Mac-Carthy
has translated, are noble instances
representing two extremes of a large
class of dramas".</p>

Death', is connected with the hopeless
rising of the Moriscoes in the Alpujarras
(1568-1570), one of whom is its
hero.&#160; It is for many reasons worthy
of note; amongst others, as showing
how far Calderon could rise above national
prejudices, and expend all the
treasures of his genius in glorifying
the heroic devotedness of a noble foe".</p>

in which the same myth [that
of Circe and Ulysses] is exhibited in a
more life-like form, though not without
some touches of allegory.&#160; Here we
have a classical plot which is adapted
to the taste of Spain in the seventeenth
century by a plentiful admixture of
episodes of love and gallantry.&#160; The
adventure is opened with nearly the
same circumstances as in the tenth
<i>Odyssey:</i> but from the moment that
Ulysses, with the help of a divine talisman,
has frustrated all the spells
(beauty excepted) of the enchantress,
the action is adapted to the manners of
a more refined and chivalrous circle".</p>

<h4><i>A Drama.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"The last drama to which Mr. Mac-Carthy
introduces us is the famous
'Devotion of the Cross'.&#160; We cannot
deny the praise of great power to this
strange and repulsive work, in which
Calderon draws us onward by a deep
and terrible dramatic interest, while
doing cruel violence to our moral
nature. . . .&#160; Our readers may be glad
to compare the translations which
Archbishop Trench and Mr. Mac-Carthy
have given us of a celebrated address
to the Cross contained in this
drama.&#160; 'Tree whereon the pitying
skies', etc.&#160; Mr. Mac-Carthy does not
appear to us to suffer from comparison
on this occasion with a true poet, who
is also a skilful translator.&#160; Indeed he
has faced the difficulties and given the
sense of the original with more decision
than Archbishop Trench".</p>

<h3>THE SORCERIES OF SIN.</h3>
<h4><i>An Auto.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"The central piece, the 'Sorceries of
Sin', is an 'Auto Sacramental', or
Morality, of which the actors represent
Man, Sin, Voluptuousness, etc., Understanding,
and the Five Senses.&#160; The
Senses are corrupted by the influence
of Sin, and figuratively changed into
wild beasts.&#160; Man, accompanied by
Understanding and Penance, demands
their liberation and encounters no
resistance; but his free-will is afterwards
seduced by the Evil Power, and his
allies reclaim him with difficulty.&#160; Yet
the plan of the apologue is embellished
with many ingenious conceits and artifices,
and conformed in the leading circumstances
with an Homeric myth&#8212;the
names of Ulysses and Circe being
frequently substituted for those of the
Man and Sin".</p>

<h3>BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST.</h3>
<h4><i>An Auto.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"The first <i>auto</i> translated is
'Belshazzar's Feast', a fortunate selection,
for it is probably unsurpassed in dramatic
effect and poetic description, and
withal is much less encumbered with
theology than most others".</p>

<h3>THE DIVINE PHILOTHEA.</h3>
<h4><i>An Auto.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"'The Divine Philothea', probably
the last work of the kind written by
Calderon, and as such worthy of attention,
inasmuch as it is the composition
of an old man of eighty-one, is conceived
with much boldness and executed
with marvellous skill.&#160; No
fewer than twenty personages are represented
on the stage, and these have
their several parts allotted to them with
great discrimination, ingenuity, and
judgment.&#160; The Senses, the Cardinal
Virtues; Paganism and Judaism; Heresy
and Atheism; the Prince of Light
and the Power of Darkness, figure
amongst the characters".</p>

<h3>THE TWO LOVERS OF HEAVEN.</h3>
<h4><i>A Drama.</i></h4>
</center>
<p>"Of these 'The Wonder-working Magician'
is most celebrated; but others,
as 'The Joseph of Women', 'The
Two Lovers of Heaven', quite deserve
to be placed on a level if not higher
than it.&#160; A tender pathetic grace is
shed over this last, which gives it a
peculiar charm".</p>

<p>"In conclusion, we heartily commend
to our readers this most interesting
and valuable specimen of Spanish
thought and devotion, wrought, as it is,
into such pure and beautiful
English. . . . .&#160; When we remember the
great literary advantages which Spain
once possessed in the intellect and faith
of her literary giants, we may well
rejoice in the appearance among us of
one of the greatest of that noble race
in the person of Calderon, especially
when introduced to us by a poet whose
claim upon our consideration has been
so emphatically made good by his own
original productions as Denis Florence
Mac-Carthy".</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Notes.</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li><i>General.</i>&#160; To simplify the Hypertext Markup Language
programming I have rendered most instances of S<font size="-2">MALL</font>
C<font size="-2">APITALS</font> as <b>bold text</b> (i.e. text within
&#60;b&#62; &#60;/b&#62; tags) which I consider to be logically
comparable.&#160; Bold text does not appear in the original printed
source book.</li>
<li><i>General.</i>&#160; Only the most obvious of printer's errors have
been corrected in this electronic edition.&#160; Some inconsistent use
of quotation marks and several forms of ellipses (with varying numbers
of dots and spaces) have been retained as originally published.&#160; I
have also retained the original's format of contractions, namely to
include a space as in "I 'll" rather than "I'll."</li>
<li><i><a href="#contents">Contents</a>.</i>&#160; The table of
contents is not in the original printed version of this play.&#160;
I have added it in this HTML version to facilitate internal navigation
by hyperlinks.</li>
<li><i><a href="#play">Play</a>, General.</i>&#160; Stage directions following
lines of spoken text are typically right justified in the printed source.&#160;
In this electronic edition they simply follow the line of spoken text.</li>
<li><i><a href="#play">Play</a>, General.</i>&#160; Various lines are indented
in the original to show continuation of a verse line from one speaker to the
next.&#160; Above I have employed white/transparent graphics with different
numbers of horizontal pixels to approximate the relative indentation of these
lines as they appear in the printed source.</li>
<li><i><a href="#play">Play</a>, General.</i>&#160; In a few places, Denis
Florence MacCarthy's (1817-1882) translation as published differs noticeably
from a Spanish (or more properly, <i>Castillano</i>) text of the drama,
published after this translation, available to this transcriber.&#160; I do not
have access to the Spanish edition that Mr. MacCarthy used as the basis of his
translation, so perhaps a better preserved version of Pedro Calder&#243;n de la
Barca's (1600-1681) drama was discovered.&#160; Or perhaps Mr. MacCarthy used
some poetic license in editing the drama.&#160; Some differences may be due to
printer's errors.&#160; Whatever the reason, I have noted below these
differences so that a reader comparing this e-book to a Spanish edition will not
be confused about these omission, and think them caused by a transcription error
of mine, or pages missing from the printed source.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s2">Act 1, Scene 2</a>.</i>&#160; Ovid's 'Remedy of Love' is
referred to three times, but as 'Remedies of Love' on the third occasion.&#160;
A Spanish text has "Remedio" the first time, and "Remedios" elsewhere.&#160; I
have found references to the work as both 'Remedium Amoris' and 'Remedia
Amoris.'</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s2">Act 1, Scene 2</a>.</i>&#160; There is an apparent
discrepancy in the play.&#160; Chloris is clearly present in the grove, and in
"Persons" is listed as one of four priestesses of Diana, yet the lines "We three
share;&#8212;'t is thy delight" and "For here three objects we behold" imply she
is not part of the group of priestesses.&#160; There is no stage direction [such
as: (<i>Chloris sits behind a tree.</i>] in the printed source, nor in a Spanish
text of the play, to explain this.&#160; Perhaps (as may be guessed from the
line "From their tender years go thither" in the previous scene) the character
is an acolyte or novice priestess played by a child.&#160; She only appears in
this scene.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s2">Act 1, Scene 2</a>.</i>&#160; "My blessings on your
choice and you! / . . . Are nothing to a pretty face."&#160; A Spanish text
gives Escarpin seventeen lines here, rather than five.&#160; The last dozen
lines contain a story of a clever vixen and a comely partridge.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s3">Act 1, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; The line "Yes, God and Man
is Christ" is not indented in the printed source, but logically should be, and
is in a Spanish text of the play.&#160; I have indented it above.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s3">Act 1, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; The line "Why delay?&#160;
Arrest them." in the printed source is shown as two lines ("Why delay? / Arrest
them."), but this seems to be a printer's error as it breaks the asonante verse
pattern.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a1s3">Act 1, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; In order to preserve the
verse, I have indented the line "Why, why, O heavens!"</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s1">Act 2, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; I have indented the line
"What then?"</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s1">Act 2, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; With the line "Clemency in
fine had won," there is another apparent discrepancy in the play.&#160; Polemius
is angry at Chrysanthus when the soldiers return in Act 1, Scene 3.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s3">Act 2, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; In the line "Here the
jasmin doubly white," the word jasmine is spelt without an "e."</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s3">Act 2, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; In Nisida's song, in the
line "The bless&#233;d rapture of forgetting", the printed source has "blessed"
without an acute accent on the second "e."&#160; Because this line is repeated
twice more in the scene with the accent, I have added it to this first instance
in the text above.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s3">Act 2, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; The printed source lists
Escarpin as the speaker of the lines "My lord, oh! hearken / To my song once
more."&#160; A Spanish text indicates that Nisida speaks here, as is only
logical, so I have listed Nisida as speaker in the text above.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a2s3">Act 2, Scene 3</a>.</i>&#160; There seems to be a gap in
the dialog after "Not myself, no aid is granted."&#160; A Spanish text has four
additional lines here:&#160; [D.] &#191;Luego t&#250; tan de su parte /
Est&#225;s, que &#225; ellos los ensalzas? / [C.] S&#237;; que he visto muchas
cosas / Hoy en mi favor obradas.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s1">Act 3, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; In a Spanish text, after
the line "I could listen to such nonsense?" Escarpin has five lines of
monolog.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s1">Act 3, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; In a Spanish text the line
"Whence did sound the voice?" is spoken by Chrysanthus, which would naturally
agree with Polemius' reply to Chrysanthus immediately below.&#160; Also, just
before this line, Chrysanthus says:&#160; Sin m&#237; me ha dejado &#225;
m&#237;.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s1">Act 3, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; In the line "The two lover
saints of Heaven." the phrase "lover saints" is not hyphenated, although the
same phrase is hyphenated just before the end of the play.&#160; The Spanish
text has "Los dos amantes del cielo" in both places.</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s1">Act 3, Scene 1</a>.</i>&#160; After the line "The two
lover saints of Heaven." there are forty lines of dialog between Escarpin and
Polemius.&#160; In typical Escarpine style, it contains a story.&#160; Here is a
free translation:&#160; A man is on trial for killing his father and loving his
mother.&#160; The judge berates the lawyer, "How dare you defend a man who has
committed the worst possible crime."&#160; The lawyer replies, "I disagree, your
Honor, for to kill his mother and love his father would, indeed, have been a
worse crime."</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s2">Act 3, Scene 2</a>.</i>&#160; There is a break in the
asonante verse at the line "They the open country seek".</li>
<li><i><a href="#a3s2">Act 3, Scene 2</a>.</i>&#160; In the line "So part pagan
and part christian", near the end of the scene, Christian is not capitalized in
the printed source.</li>
<li><i><a href="#three-note">Note 3</a>.</i>&#160; The scene actually ends
on page 17 rather than 25 in the source publication.&#160; This page
numbering problem also occurs in <a href="#twelve-note">Note 12</a> and
probably corresponds to a draught version of the publication&#8212;a detail
not caught in the final editing.&#160; The last phrase of this note was
actually printed: "the fu&#160; ll consonant rhyme."&#160; As no letters
seem to logically fit in the empty space between "fu" and "ll," I have
replaced this with the word "full" in the text above.</li>
<li><i><a href="#twelve-note">Note 12</a>.</i>&#160; This refers to
<a href="#five-note">Note 5</a>, which is actually on page 12 in the
source publication, rather than page 21.</li>
<li><i><a href="#thirteen-note">Note 13</a>.</i>&#160; The Spanish text
in the section of the drama noted is in five-lined stanzas.&#160; However,
although Mr. MacCarthy's English generally follows that metre here, he
does break the format in a several places.</li>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
